       "['Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nWhile with reverence and resignation we contemplate the dispensations of\\nDivine Providence in the alarming and destructive pestilence with which\\nseveral of our cities and towns have been visited, there is cause for\\ngratitude and mutual congratulations that the malady has disappeared and\\nthat we are again permitted to assemble in safety at the seat of Government\\nfor the discharge of our important duties. But when we reflect that this\\nfatal disorder has within a few years made repeated ravages in some of our\\nprincipal sea ports, and with increased malignancy, and when we consider\\nthe magnitude of the evils arising from the interruption of public and\\nprivate business, whereby the national interests are deeply affected, I\\nthink it my duty to invite the Legislature of the Union to examine the\\nexpediency of establishing suitable regulations in aid of the health laws\\nof the respective States; for these being formed on the idea that\\ncontagious sickness may be communicated through the channels of commerce,\\nthere seems to be a necessity that Congress, who alone can regulate trade,\\nshould frame a system which, while it may tend to preserve the general\\nhealth, may be compatible with the interests of commerce and the safety of\\nthe revenue.\\n\\nWhile we think on this calamity and sympathize with the immediate\\nsufferers, we have abundant reason to present to the Supreme Being our\\nannual oblations of gratitude for a liberal participation in the ordinary\\nblessings of His providence. To the usual subjects of gratitude I can not\\nomit to add one of the first importance to our well being and safety; I mean\\nthat spirit which has arisen in our country against the menaces and\\naggression of a foreign nation. A manly sense of national honor, dignity,\\nand independence has appeared which, if encouraged and invigorated by every\\nbranch of the Government, will enable us to view undismayed the enterprises\\nof any foreign power and become the sure foundation of national prosperity\\nand glory.\\n\\nThe course of the transactions in relation to the United States and France\\nwhich have come to my knowledge during your recess will be made the subject\\nof a future communication. That communication will confirm the ultimate\\nfailure of the measures which have been taken by the Government of the\\nUnited States toward an amicable adjustment of differences with that power.\\nYou will at the same time perceive that the French Government appears\\nsolicitous to impress the opinion that it is averse to a rupture with this\\ncountry, and that it has in a qualified manner declared itself willing to\\nreceive a minister from the United States for the purpose of restoring a\\ngood understanding. It is unfortunate for professions of this kind that\\nthey should be expressed in terms which may countenance the inadmissible\\npretension of a right to prescribe the qualifications which a minister from\\nthe United States should possess, and that while France is asserting the\\nexistence of a disposition on her part to conciliate with sincerity the\\ndifferences which have arisen, the sincerity of a like disposition on the\\npart of the United States, of which so many demonstrative proofs have been\\ngiven, should even be indirectly questioned.\\n\\nIt is also worthy of observation that the decree of the Directory alleged\\nto be intended to restrain the depredations of French cruisers on our\\ncommerce has not given, and can not give, any relief. It enjoins them to\\nconform to all the laws of France relative to cruising and prizes, while\\nthese laws are themselves the sources of the depredations of which we have\\nso long, so justly, and so fruitlessly complained.\\n\\nThe law of France enacted in January last, which subjects to capture and\\ncondemnation neutral vessels and their cargoes if any portion of the latter\\nare of British fabric or produce, although the entire property belong to\\nneutrals, instead of being rescinded has lately received a confirmation by\\nthe failure of a proposition for its repeal. While this law, which is an\\nunequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nations it attacks, continues\\nin force those nations can see in the French Government only a power\\nregardless of their essential rights, of their independence and\\nsovereignty; and if they possess the means they can reconcile nothing with\\ntheir interest and honor but a firm resistance.\\n\\nHitherto, therefore, nothing is discoverable in the conduct of France which\\nought to change or relax our measures of defense. On the contrary, to\\nextend and invigorate them is our true policy. We have no reason to regret\\nthat these measures have been thus far adopted and pursued, and in\\nproportion as we enlarge our view of the portentous and incalculable\\nsituation of Europe we shall discover new and cogent motives for the full\\ndevelopment of our energies and resources.\\n\\nBut in demonstrating by our conduct that we do not fear war in the\\nnecessary protection of our rights and honor we shall give no room to infer\\nthat we abandon the desire of peace. An efficient preparation for war can\\nalone insure peace. It is peace that we have uniformly and perseveringly\\ncultivated, and harmony between us and France may be restored at her\\noption. But to send another minister without more determinate assurances\\nthat he would be received would be an act of humiliation to which the\\nUnited States ought not to submit. It must therefore be left with France\\n(if she is indeed desirous of accommodation) to take the requisite steps.\\n\\nThe United States will steadily observe the maxims by which they have\\nhitherto been governed. They will respect the sacred rights of embassy; and\\nwith a sincere disposition on the part of France to desist from hostility,\\nto make reparation for the injuries heretofore inflicted on our commerce,\\nand to do justice in future, there will be no obstacle to the restoration\\nof a friendly intercourse.\\n\\nIn making to you this declaration I give a pledge to France and the world\\nthat the Executive authority of this country still adheres to the humane\\nand pacific policy which has invariably governed its proceedings, in\\nconformity with the wishes of the other branches of the Government and of\\nthe people of the United States. But considering the late manifestations of\\nher policy toward foreign nations, I deem it a duty deliberately and\\nsolemnly to declare my opinion that whether we negotiate with her or not,\\nvigorous preparations for war will be alike indispensable. These alone will\\ngive to us an equal treaty and insure its observance.\\n\\nAmong the measures of preparation which appear expedient, I take the\\nliberty to recall your attention to the naval establishment. The beneficial\\neffects of the small naval armament provided under the acts of the last\\nsession are known and acknowledged. Perhaps no country ever experienced\\nmore sudden and remarkable advantages from any measure of policy than we\\nhave derived from the arming for our maritime protection and defense.\\n\\nWe ought without loss of time to lay the foundation for an increase of our\\nNavy to a size sufficient to guard our coast and protect our trade. Such a\\nnaval force as it is doubtless in the power of the United States to create\\nand maintain would also afford to them the best means of general defense by\\nfacilitating the safe transportation of troops and stores to every part of\\nour extensive coast. To accomplish this important object, a prudent\\nforesight requires that systematic measures be adopted for procuring at all\\ntimes the requisite timber and other supplies. In what manner this shall be\\ndone I leave to your consideration.\\n\\nI will now advert, gentlemen, to some matters of less moment, but proper to\\nbe communicated to the National Legislature.\\n\\nAfter the Spanish garrisons had evacuated the posts they occupied at the\\nNatchez and Walnut Hills the commissioner of the United States commences\\nhis observations to ascertain the point near the Mississippi which\\nterminated the northernmost part of the 31st degree of north latitude. From\\nthence he proceeded to run the boundary line between the United States and\\nSpain. He was afterwards joined by the Spanish commissioner, when the work\\nof the former was confirmed, and they proceeded together to the demarcation\\nof the line.\\n\\nRecent information renders it probable that the Southern Indians, either\\ninstigated to oppose the demarcation or jealous of the consequences of\\nsuffering white people to run a line over lands to which the Indian title\\nhad not been extinguished, have ere this time stopped the progress of the\\ncommissioners; and considering the mischiefs which may result from\\ncontinuing the demarcation in opposition to the will of the Indian tribes,\\nthe great expense attending it, and that the boundaries which the\\ncommissioners have actually established probably extend at least as far as\\nthe Indian title has been extinguished, it will perhaps become expedient\\nand necessary to suspend further proceedings by recalling our\\ncommissioner.\\n\\nThe commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 5th article of the treaty\\nof amity, commerce, and navigation between the United States and His\\nBritannic Majesty to determine what river was truly intended under the name\\nof the river St. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace, and forming a part\\nof the boundary therein described, have finally decided that question. On\\nthe 25th of October they made their declaration that a river called\\nScoodiac, which falls into Passamaquoddy Bay at its northwestern quarter,\\nwas the true St. Croix intended in the treaty of peace, as far as its great\\nfork, where one of its streams comes from the westward and the other from\\nthe northward, and that the latter stream is the continuation of the St.\\nCroix to its source.\\n\\nThis decision, it is understood, will preclude all contention among the\\nindividual claimants, as it seems that the Scoodiac and its northern branch\\nbound the grants of land which have been made by the respective adjoining\\nGovernments.\\n\\nA subordinate question, however, it has been suggested, still remains to be\\ndetermined. Between the mouth of the St. Croix as now settled and what is\\nusually called the Bay of Fundy lie a number of valuable islands. The\\ncommissioners have not continued the boundary line through any channel of\\nthese islands, and unless the bay of Passamaquoddy be a part of the Bay of\\nFundy this further adjustment of boundary will be necessary, but it is\\napprehended that this will not be a matter of any difficulty.\\n\\nSuch progress has been made in the examination and decision of cases of\\ncaptures and condemnations of American vessels which were the subject of\\nthe 7th article of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation between\\nthe United States and Great Britain that it is supposed the commissioners\\nwill be able to bring their business to a conclusion in August of the\\nensuing year.\\n\\nThe commissioners acting under the 25th article of the treaty between the\\nUnited States and Spain have adjusted most of the claims of our citizens\\nfor losses sustained in consequence of their vessels and cargoes having\\nbeen taken by the subjects of His Catholic Majesty during the late war\\nbetween France and Spain.\\n\\nVarious circumstances have concurred to delay the execution of the law for\\naugmenting the military establishment, among these the desire of obtaining\\nthe fullest information to direct the best selection of officers. As this\\nobject will now be speedily accomplished, it is expected that the raising\\nand organizing of the troops will proceed without obstacle and with\\neffect.\\n\\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nI have directed an estimate of the appropriations which will be necessary\\nfor the service of the ensuing year to be laid before you, accompanied with\\na view of the public receipts and expenditures to a recent period.\\n\\nIt will afford you satisfaction to infer the great extent and solidity of\\nthe public resources from the prosperous state of the finances,\\nnotwithstanding the unexampled embarrassments which have attended commerce.\\nWhen you reflect on the conspicuous examples of patriotism and liberality\\nwhich have been exhibited by our mercantile fellow citizens, and how great\\na proportion of the public resources depends on their enterprise, you will\\nnaturally consider whether their convenience can not be promoted and\\nreconciled with the security of the revenue by a revision of the system by\\nwhich the collection is at present regulated.\\n\\nDuring your recess measures have been steadily pursued for effecting the\\nvaluations and returns directed by the act of the last session, preliminary\\nto the assessment and collection of a direct tax. No other delays or\\nobstacles have been experienced except such as were expected to arise from\\nthe great extent of our country and the magnitude and novelty of the\\noperation, and enough has been accomplished to assure a fulfillment of the\\nviews of the Legislature.\\n\\nGentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nI can not close this address without once more adverting to our political\\nsituation and inculcating the essential importance of uniting in the\\nmaintenance of our dearest interests; and I trust that by the temper and\\nwisdom of your proceedings and by a harmony of measures we shall secure to\\nour country that weight and respect to which it is so justly entitled.',\n",
       " \"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nThe assemblage of the representatives of our Union in both Houses of\\nthe Congress at this time occurs under circumstances calling for the\\nrenewed homage of our grateful acknowledgments to the Giver of All\\nGood. With the exceptions incidental to the most felicitous condition\\nof human existence, we continue to be highly favored in all the\\nelements which contribute to individual comfort and to national\\nprosperity. In the survey of our extensive country we have generally to\\nobserve abodes of health and regions of plenty. In our civil and\\npolitical relations we have peace without and tranquillity within our\\nborders. We are, as a people, increasing with unabated rapidity in\\npopulation, wealth, and national resources, and whatever differences of\\nopinion exist among us with regard to the mode and the means by which\\nwe shall turn the beneficence of Heaven to the improvement of our own\\ncondition, there is yet a spirit animating us all which will not suffer\\nthe bounties of Providence to be showered upon us in vain, but will\\nreceive them with grateful hearts, and apply them with unwearied hands\\nto the advancement of the general good.\\n\\nOf the subjects recommended to Congress at their last session, some\\nwere then definitively acted upon. Others, left unfinished, but partly\\nmatured, will recur to your attention without needing a renewal of\\nnotice from me. The purpose of this communication will be to present to\\nyour view the general aspect of our public affairs at this moment and\\nthe measures which have been taken to carry into effect the intentions\\nof the Legislature as signified by the laws then and heretofore\\nenacted.\\n\\nIn our intercourse with the other nations of the earth we have still\\nthe happiness of enjoying peace and a general good understanding,\\nqualified, however, in several important instances by collisions of\\ninterest and by unsatisfied claims of justice, to the settlement of\\nwhich the constitutional interposition of the legislative authority may\\nbecome ultimately indispensable.\\n\\nBy the decease of the Emperor Alexander of Russia, which occurred\\ncontemporaneously with the commencement of the last session of\\nCongress, the United States have been deprived of a long tried, steady,\\nand faithful friend. Born to the inheritance of absolute power and\\ntrained in the school of adversity, from which no power on earth,\\nhowever absolute, is exempt, that monarch from his youth had been\\ntaught to feel the force and value of public opinion and to be sensible\\nthat the interests of his own Government would best be promoted by a\\nfrank and friendly intercourse with this Republic, as those of his\\npeople would be advanced by a liberal intercourse with our country. A\\ncandid and confidential interchange of sentiments between him and the\\nGovernment of the United States upon the affairs of Southern America\\ntook place at a period not long preceding his demise, and contributed\\nto fix that course of policy which left to the other Governments of\\nEurope no alternative but that of sooner or later recognizing the\\nindependence of our southern neighbors, of which the example had by the\\nUnited States already been set.\\n\\nThe ordinary diplomatic communications between his successor, the\\nEmperor Nicholas, and the United States have suffered some interruption\\nby the illness, departure, and subsequent decease of his minister\\nresiding here, who enjoyed, as he merited, the entire confidence of his\\nnew sovereign, as he had eminently responded to that of his\\npredecessor. But we have had the most satisfactory assurances that the\\nsentiments of the reigning Emperor toward the United States are\\naltogether conformable to those which had so long and constantly\\nanimated his imperial brother, and we have reason to hope that they\\nwill serve to cement that harmony and good understanding between the\\ntwo nations which, founded in congenial interests, can not but result\\nin the advancement of the welfare and prosperity of both.\\n\\nOur relations of commerce and navigation with France are, by the\\noperation of the convention of June 24th, 1822, with that nation, in a\\nstate of gradual and progressive improvement. Convinced by all our\\nexperience, no less than by the principles of fair and liberal\\nreciprocity which the United States have constantly tendered to all the\\nnations of the earth as the rule of commercial intercourse which they\\nwould universally prefer, that fair and equal competition is most\\nconducive to the interests of both parties, the United States in the\\nnegotiation of that convention earnestly contended for a mutual\\nrenunciation of discriminating duties and charges in the ports of the\\ntwo countries. Unable to obtain the immediate recognition of this\\nprinciple in its full extent, after reducing the duties of\\ndiscrimination so far as was found attainable it was agreed that at the\\nexpiration of two years from October 1st, 1822, when the convention was\\nto go into effect, unless a notice of six months on either side should\\nbe given to the other that the convention itself must terminate, those\\nduties should be reduced one quarter, and that this reduction should be\\nyearly repeated, until all discrimination should cease, while the\\nconvention itself should continue in force. By the effect of this\\nstipulation three quarters of the discriminating duties which had been\\nlevied by each party upon the vessels of the other in its ports have\\nalready been removed; and on the first of next October, should the\\nconvention be still in force, the remaining one quarter will be\\ndiscontinued. French vessels laden with French produce will be received\\nin our ports on the same terms as our own, and ours in return will\\nenjoy the same advantages in the ports of France.\\n\\nBy these approximations to an equality of duties and of charges not\\nonly has the commerce between the two countries prospered, but friendly\\ndispositions have been on both sides encouraged and promoted. They will\\ncontinue to be cherished and cultivated on the part of the United\\nStates. It would have been gratifying to have had it in my power to add\\nthat the claims upon the justice of the French Government, involving\\nthe property and the comfortable subsistence of many of our fellow\\ncitizens, and which have been so long and so earnestly urged, were in a\\nmore promising train of adjustment than at your last meeting; but their\\ncondition remains unaltered.\\n\\nWith the Government of the Netherlands the mutual abandonment of\\ndiscriminating duties had been regulated by legislative acts on both\\nsides. The act of Congress of April 20th, 1818, abolished all\\ndiscriminating duties of impost and tonnage upon the vessels and\\nproduce of the Netherlands in the ports of the United States upon the\\nassurance given by the Government of the Netherlands that all such\\nduties operating against the shipping and commerce of the United States\\nin that Kingdom had been abolished. These reciprocal regulations had\\ncontinued in force several years when the discriminating principle was\\nresumed by the Netherlands in a new and indirect form by a bounty of\\n10% in the shape of a return of duties to their national vessels, and\\nin which those of the United States are not permitted to participate.\\nBy the act of Congress of January 7th, 1824, all discriminating duties\\nin the United States were again suspended, so far as related to the\\nvessels and produce of the Netherlands, so long as the reciprocal\\nexemption should be extended to the vessels and produce of the United\\nStates in the Netherlands. But the same act provides that in the event\\nof a restoration of discriminating duties to operate against the\\nshipping and commerce of the United States in any of the foreign\\ncountries referred to therein the suspension of discriminating duties\\nin favor of the navigation of such foreign country should cease and all\\nthe provisions of the acts imposing discriminating foreign tonnage and\\nimpost duties in the United States should revive and be in full force\\nwith regard to that nation.\\n\\nIn the correspondence with the Government of the Netherlands upon this\\nsubject they have contended that the favor shown to their own shipping\\nby this bounty upon their tonnage is not to be considered a\\ndiscriminating duty; but it can not be denied that it produces all the\\nsame effects. Had the mutual abolition been stipulated by treaty, such\\na bounty upon the national vessels could scarcely have been granted\\nconsistent with good faith. Yet as the act of Congress of January 7th,\\n1824 has not expressly authorized the Executive authority to determine\\nwhat shall be considered as a revival of discriminating duties by a\\nforeign government to the disadvantage of the United States, and as the\\nretaliatory measure on our part, however just and necessary, may tend\\nrather to that conflict of legislation which we deprecate than to that\\nconcert to which we invite all commercial nations, as most conducive to\\ntheir interest and our own, I have thought it more consistent with the\\nspirit of our institutions to refer to the subject again to the\\nparamount authority of the Legislature to decide what measure the\\nemergency may require than abruptly by proclamation to carry into\\neffect the minatory provisions of the act of 1824.\\n\\nDuring the last session of Congress treaties of amity, navigation, and\\ncommerce were negotiated and signed at this place with the Government\\nof Denmark, in Europe, and with the Federation of Central America, in\\nthis hemisphere. These treaties then received the constitutional\\nsanction of the Senate, by the advice and consent to their\\nratification. They were accordingly ratified on the part of the United\\nStates, and during the recess of Congress have been also ratified by\\nthe other respective contracting parties. The ratifications have been\\nexchanged, and they have been published by proclamations, copies of\\nwhich are herewith communicated to Congress.\\n\\nThese treaties have established between the contracting parties the\\nprinciples of equality and reciprocity in their broadest and most\\nliberal extent, each party admitting the vessels of the other into its\\nports, laden with cargoes the produce or manufacture of any quarter of\\nthe globe, upon the payment of the same duties of tonnage and impost\\nthat are chargeable upon their own. They have further stipulated that\\nthe parties shall hereafter grant no favor of navigation or commerce to\\nany other nation which shall not upon the same terms be granted to each\\nother, and that neither party will impose upon articles of merchandise\\nthe produce or manufacture of the other any other or higher duties than\\nupon the like articles being the produce or manufacture of any other\\ncountry. To these principles there is in the convention with Denmark an\\nexception with regard to the colonies of that Kingdom in the arctic\\nseas, but none with regard to her colonies in the West Indies.\\n\\nIn the course of the last summer the term to which our last commercial\\ntreaty with Sweden was limited has expired. A continuation of it is in\\nthe contemplation of the Swedish Government, and is believed to be\\ndesirable on the part of the United States. It has been proposed by the\\nKing of Sweden that pending the negotiation of renewal the expired\\ntreaty should be mutually considered as still in force, a measure which\\nwill require the sanction of Congress to be carried into effect on our\\npart, and which I therefore recommend to your consideration.\\n\\nWith Prussia, Spain, Portugal, and, in general, all the European powers\\nbetween whom and the United States relations of friendly intercourse\\nhave existed their condition has not materially varied since the last\\nsession of Congress. I regret not to be able to say the same of our\\ncommercial intercourse with the colonial possessions of Great Britain\\nin America. Negotiations of the highest importance to our common\\ninterests have been for several years in discussion between the two\\nGovernments, and on the part of the United States have been invariably\\npursued in the spirit of candor and conciliation. Interests of great\\nmagnitude and delicacy had been adjusted by the conventions of 1815 and\\n1818, while that of 1822, mediated by the late Emperor Alexander, had\\npromised a satisfactory compromise of claims which the Government of\\nthe United States, in justice to the rights of a numerous class of\\ntheir citizens, was bound to sustain.\\n\\nBut with regard to the commercial intercourse between the United States\\nand the British colonies in America, it has been hitherto found\\nimpracticable to bring the parties to an understanding satisfactory to\\nboth. The relative geographical position and the respective products of\\nnature cultivated by human industry had constituted the elements of a\\ncommercial intercourse between the United States and British America,\\ninsular and continental, important to the inhabitants of both\\ncountries; but it had been interdicted by Great Britain upon a\\nprinciple heretofore practiced upon by the colonizing nations of\\nEurope, of holding the trade of their colonies each in exclusive\\nmonopoly to herself.\\n\\nAfter the termination of the late war this interdiction had been\\nrevived, and the British Government declined including this portion of\\nour intercourse with her possessions in the negotiation of the\\nconvention of 1815. The trade was then carried on exclusively in\\nBritish vessels 'til the act of Congress, concerning navigation, of\\n1818 and the supplemental act of 1820 met the interdict by a\\ncorresponding measure on the part of the United States. These measures,\\nnot of retaliation, but of necessary self defense, were soon succeeded\\nby an act of Parliament opening certain colonial ports to the vessels\\nof the United States coming directly from them, and to the importation\\nfrom them of certain articles of our produce burdened with heavy\\nduties, and excluding some of the most valuable articles of our\\nexports. The United States opened their ports to British vessels from\\nthe colonies upon terms as exactly corresponding with those of the act\\nof Parliament as in the relative position of the parties could be made,\\nand a negotiation was commenced by mutual consent, with the hope on our\\npart that a reciprocal spirit of accommodation and a common sentiment\\nof the importance of the trade to the interests of the inhabitants of\\nthe two countries between whom it must be carried on would ultimately\\nbring the parties to a compromise with which both might be satisfied.\\nWith this view the Government of the United States had determined to\\nsacrifice something of that entire reciprocity which in all commercial\\narrangements with foreign powers they are entitled to demand, and to\\nacquiesce in some inequalities disadvantageous to ourselves rather than\\nto forego the benefit of a final and permanent adjustment of this\\ninterest to the satisfaction of Great Britain herself. The negotiation,\\nrepeatedly suspended by accidental circumstances, was, however, by\\nmutual agreement and express assent, considered as pending and to be\\nspeedily resumed.\\n\\nIn the mean time another act of Parliament, so doubtful and ambiguous\\nin its import as to have been misunderstood by the officers in the\\ncolonies who were to carry it into execution, opens again certain\\ncolonial ports upon new conditions and terms, with a threat to close\\nthem against any nation which may not accept those terms as prescribed\\nby the British Government. This act, passed July, 1825, not\\ncommunicated to the Government of the United States, not understood by\\nthe British officers of the customs in the colonies where it was to be\\nenforced, was never the less submitted to the consideration of Congress\\nat their last session. With the knowledge that a negotiation upon the\\nsubject had long been in progress and pledges given of its resumption\\nat an early day, it was deemed expedient to await the result of that\\nnegotiation rather than to subscribe implicitly to terms the import of\\nwhich was not clear and which the British authorities themselves in\\nthis hemisphere were not prepared to explain.\\n\\nImmediately after the close of the last session of Congress one of our\\nmost distinguished citizens was dispatched as envoy extraordinary and\\nminister plenipotentiary to Great Britain, furnished with instructions\\nwhich we could not doubt would lead to a conclusion of this long\\ncontroverted interest upon terms acceptable to Great Britain. Upon his\\narrival, and before he had delivered his letters of credence, he was\\nbet by an order of the British council excluding from and after the\\nfirst of December now current the vessels of the United States from all\\nthe colonial British ports excepting those immediately bordering on our\\nterritories. In answer to his expostulations upon a measure thus\\nunexpected he is informed that according to the ancient maxims of\\npolicy of European nations having colonies their trade is an exclusive\\npossession of the mother country; that all participation in it by other\\nnations is a boon or favor not forming a subject of negotiation, but to\\nbe regulated by the legislative acts of the power owning the colony;\\nthat the British Government therefore declines negotiating concerning\\nit, and that as the United States did not forthwith accept purely and\\nsimply the terms offered by the act of Parliament of July, 1825, Great\\nBritain would not now admit the vessels of the United States even upon\\nthe terms on which she has opened them to the navigation of other\\nnations.\\n\\nWe have been accustomed to consider the trade which we have enjoyed\\nwith the British colonies rather as an interchange of mutual benefits\\nthan as a mere favor received; that under every circumstance we have\\ngiven an ample equivalent. We have seen every other nation holding\\ncolonies negotiate with other nations and grant them freely admission\\nto the colonies by treaty, and so far are the other colonizing nations\\nof Europe now from refusing to negotiate for trade with their colonies\\nthat we ourselves have secured access to the colonies of more than one\\nof them by treaty. The refusal, however, of Great Britain to negotiate\\nleaves to the United States no other alternative than that of\\nregulating or interdicting altogether the trade on their part,\\naccording as either measure may effect the interests of our own\\ncountry, and with that exclusive object I would recommend the whole\\nsubject to your calm and candid deliberations.\\n\\nIt is hoped that our unavailing exertions to accomplish a cordial good\\nunderstanding on this interest will not have an unpropitious effect\\nupon the other great topics of discussion between the two Governments.\\nOur north-eastern and north-western boundaries are still unadjusted.\\nThe commissioners under the 7th article of the treaty of Ghent have\\nnearly come to the close of their labors; nor can we renounce the\\nexpectation, enfeebled as it is, that they may agree upon their report\\nto the satisfaction or acquiescence of both parties. The commission for\\nliquidating the claims for indemnity for slaves carried away after the\\nclose of the war has been sitting, with doubtful prospects of success.\\nPropositions of compromise have, however, passed between the two\\nGovernments, the result of which we flatter ourselves may yet prove\\nunsatisfactory. Our own dispositions and purposes toward Great Britain\\nare all friendly and conciliatory; nor can we abandon but with strong\\nreluctance the belief that they will ultimately meet a return, not of\\nfavors, which we neither as nor desire, but of equal reciprocity and\\ngood will.\\n\\nWith the American Governments of this hemisphere we continue to\\nmaintain an intercourse altogether friendly, and between their nations\\nand ours that commercial interchange of which mutual benefit is the\\nsource of mutual comfort and harmony the result is in a continual state\\nof improvement. The war between Spain and them since the total\\nexpulsion of the Spanish military force from their continental\\nterritories has been little more than nominal, and their internal\\ntranquillity, though occasionally menaced by the agitations which civil\\nwars never fail to leave behind them, has not been affected by any\\nserious calamity.\\n\\nThe congress of ministers from several of those nations which assembled\\nat Panama, after a short session there, adjourned to meet again at a\\nmore favorable season in the neighborhood of Mexico. The decease of one\\nof our ministers on his way to the Isthmus, and the impediments of the\\nseason, which delayed the departure of the other, deprived United\\nStates of the advantage of being represented at the first meeting of\\nthe congress. There is, however, no reason to believe that any\\ntransactions of the congress were of a nature to affect injuriously the\\ninterests of the United States or to require the interposition of our\\nministers had they been present. Their absence has, indeed, deprived\\nUnited States of the opportunity of possessing precise and authentic\\ninformation of the treaties which were concluded at Panama; and the\\nwhole result has confirmed me in the conviction of the expediency to\\nthe United States of being represented at the congress. The surviving\\nmember of the mission, appointed during your last session, has\\naccordingly proceeded to his destination, and a successor to his\\ndistinguished and lamented associate will be nominated to the Senate. A\\ntreaty of amity, navigation, and commerce has in the course of the last\\nsummer been concluded by our minister plenipotentiary at Mexico with\\nthe united states of that Confederacy, which will also be laid before\\nthe Senate for their advice with regard to its ratification.\\n\\nIn adverting to the present condition of our fiscal concerns and to the\\nprospects of our revenue the first remark that calls our attention is\\nthat they are less exuberantly prosperous than they were at the\\ncorresponding period of the last year. The severe shock so extensively\\nsustained by the commercial and manufacturing interests in Great\\nBritain has not been without a perceptible recoil upon ourselves. A\\nreduced importation from abroad is necessarily succeeded by a reduced\\nreturn to the Treasury at home. The net revenue of the present year\\nwill not equal that of the last, and the receipts of that which is to\\ncome will fall short of those in the current year. The diminution,\\nhowever, is in part attributable to the flourishing condition of some\\nof our domestic manufactures, and so far is compensated by an\\nequivalent more profitable to the nation.\\n\\nIt is also highly gratifying to perceive that the deficiency in the\\nrevenue, while it scarcely exceeds the anticipations of the last year's\\nestimate from the Treasury, has not interrupted the application of more\\nthan $11 millions during the present year to the discharge of the\\nprincipal and interest of the debt, nor the reduction of upward of\\n$7,000,000 of the capital of the debt itself. The balance in the\\nTreasury on the first of January last was $5,201,650.43; the receipts\\nfrom that time to the 30th of September last were $19,585,932.50; the\\nreceipts of the current quarter, estimated at $6,000,000, yield, with\\nthe sums already received, a revenue of about $25,500,000 for the year;\\nthe expenditures for the first 3 quarters of the year have amounted to\\n$18,714,226.66; the expenditures of the current quarter are expected,\\nincluding the $2,000,000 of the principal of the debt to be paid, to\\nbalance the receipts; so that the expense of the year, amounting to\\nupward of $1,000,000 less than its income, will leave a proportionally\\nincreased balance in the Treasury on January 1st, 1827, over that of\\nthe first of January last; instead of $5,200,000 there will be\\n$6,400,000.\\n\\nThe amount of duties secured on merchandise imported from the commence\\nof the year 'til September 30 is estimated at $21,250,000, and the\\namount that will probably accrue during the present quarter is\\nestimated at $4,250,000, making for the whole year $25,500,000, from\\nwhich the draw-backs being deducted will leave a clear revenue from the\\ncustoms receivable in the year 1827 of about $20,400,000, which, with\\nthe sums to be received from the proceeds of public lands, the bank\\ndividends, and other incidental receipts, will form an aggregate of\\nabout $23,000,000, a sum falling short of the whole expenses of the\\npresent year little more than the portion of those expenditures applied\\nto the discharge of the public debt beyond the annual appropriation of\\n$10,000,000 by the act of March 3d, 1817. At the passage of that act\\nthe public debt amounted to $123,500,000. On the first of January next\\nit will be short of $74,000,000. In the lapse of these 10 years\\n$50,000,000 of public debt, with the annual charge of upward of\\n$3,000,000 of interest upon them, have been extinguished. At the\\npassage of tat act, of the annual appropriation of $10,000,000,\\n$7,000,000 were absorbed in the payment of interest, and not more than\\n$3,000,000 went to reduce the capital of the debt. Of the same\\n$10,000,000, at this time scarcely $4,000,000 are applicable to the\\ninterest and upward of $6,000,000 are effective in melting down the\\ncapital.\\n\\nYet our experience has proved that a revenue consisting so largely of\\nimposts and tonnage ebbs and flows to an extraordinary extent, with all\\nthe fluctuations incident to the general commerce of the world. It is\\nwithin our recollection that even in the compass of the same last ten\\nyears the receipts of the Treasury were not adequate to the\\nexpenditures of the year, and that in two successive years it was found\\nnecessary to resort to loans to meet the engagements of the nation. The\\nreturning tides of the succeeding years replenished the public coffers\\nuntil they have again begun to feel the vicissitude of a decline. To\\nproduce these alternations of fullness and exhaustion the relative\\noperation of abundant or unfruitful seasons, the regulations of foreign\\ngovernments, political revolutions, the prosperous or decaying\\ncondition of manufactures, commercial speculations, and many other\\ncauses, not always to be traced, variously combine.\\n\\nWe have found the alternate swells and diminutions embracing periods of\\nfrom two to three years. The last period of depression to United States\\nwas from 1819 to 1822. The corresponding revival was from 1823 to the\\ncommencement of the present year. Still, we have no cause to apprehend\\na depression comparable to that of the former period, or even to\\nanticipate a deficiency which will intrench upon the ability to apply\\nthe annual $10 millions to the reduction of the debt. It is well for\\nus, however, to be admonished of the necessity of abiding by the maxims\\nof the most vigilant economy, and of resorting to all honorable and\\nuseful expedients for pursuing with steady and inflexible perseverance\\nthe total discharge of the debt.\\n\\nBesides the $7,000,000 of the loans of 1813 which will have been\\ndischarged in the course of the present year, there are $9,000,000\\nwhich by the terms of the contracts would have been and are now\\nredeemable. $13,000,000 more of the loan of 1814 will become redeemable\\nfrom and after the expiration of the present month, and $9,000,000\\nother from and after the close of the ensuing year. They constitute a\\nmass of $31,000,000, all bearing an interest of 6%, more than\\n$20,000,000 of which will be immediately redeemable, and the rest\\nwithin little more than a year. Leaving of this amount $15,000,000 to\\ncontinue at the interest of 6%, but to be paid off as far as shall be\\nfound practicable in the years 1827 and 1828, there is scarcely a doubt\\nthat the remaining $16,000,000 might within a few months be discharged\\nby a loan at not exceeding 5%, redeemable in the years 1829 and 1830.\\nBy this operation a sum of nearly $500,000 may be saved to the nation,\\nand the discharge of the whole $31,000,000 within the four years may be\\ngreatly facilitated if not wholly accomplished.\\n\\nBy an act of Congress of March 3d, 1825, a loan for the purpose now\\nreferred to, or a subscription to stock, was authorized, at an interest\\nnot exceeding 4.5%. But at that time so large a portion of the floating\\ncapital of the country was absorbed in commercial speculations and so\\nlittle was left for investment in the stocks that the measure was but\\npartially successful. At the last session of Congress the condition of\\nthe funds was still unpropitious to the measure; but the change so soon\\nafterwards occurred that, had the authority existed to redeem the $9\\nmillions now redeemable by an exchange of stocks or a loan at 5%, it is\\nmorally certain that it might have been effected, and with it a yearly\\nsaving of $90,000.\\n\\nWith regard to the collection of the revenue of imposts, certain\\noccurrences have within the last year been disclosed in one or two of\\nour principal ports, which engaged the attention of Congress at their\\nlast session and may hereafter require further consideration. Until\\nwithin a very few years the execution of the laws for raising the\\nrevenue, like that of all our other laws, has been insured more by the\\nmoral sense of the community than by the rigors of a jealous precaution\\nor by penal sanction. Confiding in the exemplary punctuality and\\nunsullied integrity of our importing merchants, a gradual relaxation\\nfrom the provisions of the collection laws, a close adherence to which\\nhave caused inconvenience and expense to them, had long become\\nhabitual, and indulgences had been extended universally because they\\nhad never been abused. It may be worthy of your serious consideration\\nwhether some further legislative provision may not be necessary to come\\nin aid of this state of unguarded security.\\n\\nFrom the reports herewith communicated of the Secretaries of War and of\\nthe Navy, with the subsidiary documents annexed to them, will be\\ndiscovered the present condition and administration of our military\\nestablishment on the land and on the sea. The organization of the Army\\nhaving undergone no change since its reduction to the present peace\\nestablishment in 1821, it remains only to observe that it is yet found\\nadequate to all the purposes for which a permanent armed force in time\\nof peace can be needed or useful. It may be proper to add that, from a\\ndifference of opinion between the late President of the United States\\nand the Senate with regard to the construction of the act of Congress\\nof March 2d, 1821, to reduce and fix the military peace establishment\\nof the United States, it remains hitherto so far without execution that\\nno colonel has been appointed to command one of the regiments of\\nartillery. A supplementary or explanatory act of the Legislature\\nappears to be the only expedient practicable for removing the\\ndifficulty of this appointment.\\n\\nIn a period of profound peace the conduct of the mere military\\nestablishment forms but a very inconsiderable portion of the duties\\ndevolving upon the administration of the Department of War. It will be\\nseen by the returns from the subordinate departments of the Army that\\nevery branch of the service is marked with order, regularity, and\\ndiscipline; that from the commanding general through all the gradations\\nof superintendence the officers feel themselves to have been citizens\\nbefore they were soldiers, and that the glory of a republican army must\\nconsist in the spirit of freedom, by which it is animated, and of\\npatriotism, by which it is impelled. It may be confidently stated that\\nthe moral character of the Army is in a state of continual improvement,\\nand that all the arrangements for the disposal of its parts have a\\nconstant reference to that end.\\n\\nBut to the War Department are attributed other duties, having, indeed,\\nrelation to a future possible condition of war, but being purely\\ndefensive, and in their tendency contributing rather to the security\\nand permanency of peace--the erection of the fortifications provided\\nfor by Congress, and adapted to secure our shores from hostile\\ninvasion; the distribution of the fund of public gratitude and justice\\nto the pensioners of the Revolutionary war; the maintenance of our\\nrelations of peace and protection with the Indian tribes, and the\\ninternal improvements and surveys for the location of roads and canals,\\nwhich during the last three sessions of Congress have engaged so much\\nof their attention, and may engross so large a share of their future\\nbenefactions to our country.\\n\\nBy the act of April 30th, 1824, suggested and approved by my\\npredecessor, the sum of $30,000 was appropriated for the purpose of\\ncausing to be made the necessary surveys, plans, and estimates of the\\nroutes of such roads and canals as the President of the United States\\nmight deem of national importance in a commercial or military point of\\nview, or necessary for the transportation of the public mail. The\\nsurveys, plans, and estimates for each, when completed, will be laid\\nbefore Congress.\\n\\nIn execution of this act a board of engineers was immediately\\ninstituted, and have been since most assiduously and constantly\\noccupied in carrying it into effect. The first object to which their\\nlabors were directed, by order of the late President, was the\\nexamination of the country between the tide waters of the Potomac, the\\nOhio, and Lake Erie, to ascertain the practicability of a communication\\nbetween them, to designate the most suitable route for the same, and to\\nform plans and estimates in detail of the expense of execution.\\n\\nOn March 2d, 1825, they made their first report, which was immediately\\ncommunicated to Congress, and in which they declared that having\\nmaturely considered the circumstances observed by them personally, and\\ncarefully studied the results of such of the preliminary surveys as\\nwere then completed, they were decidedly of opinion that the\\ncommunication was practicable.\\n\\nAt the last session of Congress, before the board of engineers were\\nenabled to make up their second report containing a general plan and\\npreparatory estimate for the work, the Committee of the House of\\nRepresentatives upon Roads and Canals closed the session with a report\\nexpressing the hope that the plan and estimate of the board of\\nengineers might at this time be prepared, and that the subject be\\nreferred to the early and favorable consideration of Congress at their\\npresent session. That expected report of the board of engineers is\\nprepared, and will forthwith be laid before you.\\n\\nUnder the resolution of Congress authorizing the Secretary of War to\\nhave prepared a complete system of cavalry tactics, and a system of\\nexercise and instruction of field artillery, for the use of the militia\\nof the United States, to be reported to Congress at the present\\nsession, a board of distinguished officers of the Army and of the\\nmilitia has been convened, whose report will be submitted to you with\\nthat of the Secretary of War. The occasion was thought favorable for\\nconsulting the same board, aided by the results of a correspondence\\nwith the governors of the several States and Territories and other\\ncitizens of intelligence and experience, upon the acknowledged\\ndefective condition of our militia system, and of the improvements of\\nwhich it is susceptible. The report of the board upon this subject is\\nalso submitted for your consideration.\\n\\nIn the estimates of appropriations for the ensuing year upward of $5\\nmillions will be submitted for the expenditures to be paid from the\\nDepartment of War. Less than two fifths of this will be applicable to\\nthe maintenance and support of the Army. $1,500,000, in the form of\\npensions, goes as a scarcely adequate tribute to the services and\\nsacrifices of a former age, and a more than equal sum invested in\\nfortifications, or for the preparations of internal improvement,\\nprovides for the quiet, the comfort, and happier existence of the ages\\nto come. The appropriations to indemnify those unfortunate remnants of\\nanother race unable alike to share in the enjoyments and to exist in\\nthe presence of civilization, though swelling in recent years to a\\nmagnitude burdensome to the Treasury, are generally not without their\\nequivalents in profitable value, or serve to discharge the Union from\\nengagements more burdensome than debt.\\n\\nIn like manner the estimate of appropriations for the Navy Department\\nwill present an aggregate sum of upward of $3,000,000. About half of\\nthese, however, covers the current expenditures of the Navy in actual\\nservice, and half constitutes a fund of national property, the pledge\\nof our future glory and defense. It was scarcely one short year after\\nthe close of the late war, and when the burden of its expenses and\\ncharges was weighing heaviest upon the country, that Congress, by the\\nact of April 29th, 1816, appropriated $1,000,000 annually for eight\\nyears to the gradual increase of the Navy. At a subsequent period this\\nannual appropriation was reduced to $500,000 for six years, of which\\nthe present year is the last. A yet more recent appropriation the last\\ntwo years, for building ten sloops of war, has nearly restored the\\noriginal appropriation of 1816 of $1,000,000 for every year.\\n\\nThe result is before United States all. We have 12 line-of-battle\\nships, 20 frigates, and sloops of war in proportion, which, with a few\\nmonths preparation, may present a line of floating fortifications along\\nthe whole range of our coast ready to meet any invader who might\\nattempt to set foot upon our shores. Combining with a system of\\nfortifications upon the shores themselves, commenced about the same\\ntime under the auspices of my immediate predecessor, and hitherto\\nsystematically pursued, it has placed in our possession the most\\neffective sinews of war and has left us at once an example and a lesson\\nfrom which our own duties may be inferred.\\n\\nThe gradual increase of the Navy was the principle of which the act of\\nApril 29th, 1816, was the first development. It was the introduction of\\na system to act upon the character and history of our country for an\\nindefinite series of ages. It was a declaration of that Congress to\\ntheir constituents and to posterity that it was the destiny and the\\nduty of these confederated States to become in regular process of time\\nand by no petty advances a great naval power. That which they proposed\\nto accomplish in eight years is rather to be considered as the measure\\nof their means that the limitation of their design. They looked forward\\nfor a term of years sufficient for the accomplishment of a definite\\nportion of their purpose, and they left to their successors to fill up\\nthe canvas of which they had traced the large and prophetic outline.\\nThe ships of the line and frigates which they had in contemplation will\\nbe shortly completed. The time which they had allotted for the\\naccomplishment of the work has more than elapsed. It remains for your\\nconsideration how their successors may contribute their portion of toil\\nand of treasure for the benefit of the succeeding age in the gradual\\nincrease of our Navy.\\n\\nThere is perhaps no part of the exercise of the constitutional powers\\nof the Federal Government which has given more general satisfaction to\\nthe people of the Union than this. The system has not been thus\\nvigorously introduced and hitherto sustained to be now departed from or\\nabandoned. In continuing to provide for the gradual increase of the\\nNavy it may not be necessary or expedient to add for the present any\\nmore to the number of our ships; but should you deem it advisable to\\ncontinue the yearly appropriation of $0.5 millions to the same objects,\\nit may be profitably expended in a providing a supply of timber to be\\nseasoned and other materials for future use in the construction of\\ndocks or in laying the foundations of a school for naval education, as\\nto the wisdom of Congress either of those measures may appear to claim\\nthe preference.\\n\\nOf the small portions of this Navy engaged in actual service during the\\npeace, squadrons have continued to be maintained in the Pacific Ocean,\\nin the West India seas, and in the Mediterranean, to which has been\\nadded a small armament to cruise on the eastern coast of South America.\\nIn all they have afforded protection to our commerce, have contributed\\nto make our country advantageously known to foreign nations, have\\nhonorably employed multitudes of our sea men in the service of their\\ncountry, and have inured numbers of youths of the rising generation to\\nlives of manly hardihood and of nautical experience and skill.\\n\\nThe piracies with which the West India seas were for several years\\ninfested have been totally suppressed, but in the Mediterranean they\\nhave increased in a manner afflictive to other nations, and but for the\\ncontinued presence of our squadron would probably have been distressing\\nto our own.\\n\\nThe war which has unfortunately broken out between the Republic of\\nBuenos Ayres and the Brazilian Government has given rise to very great\\nirregularities among the naval officers of the latter, by whom\\nprinciples in relation to blockades and to neutral navigation have been\\nbrought forward to which we can not subscribe and which our own\\ncommanders have found it necessary to resist. From the friendly\\ndisposition toward the United States constantly manifested by the\\nEmperor of Brazil, and the very useful and friendly commercial\\nintercourse between the United States and his dominions, we have reason\\nto believe that the just reparation demanded for the injuries sustained\\nby several of our citizens from some of his officers will not be\\nwithheld. Abstracts from the recent dispatches of the commanders of our\\nseveral squadrons are communicated with the report of the Secretary of\\nthe Navy to Congress.\\n\\nA report from the Post Master General is likewise communicated,\\npresenting in a highly satisfactory manner the result of a vigorous,\\nefficient, and economical administration of that Department. The\\nrevenue of the office, even of the year including the latter half of\\n1824 and the first half of 1825, had exceeded its expenditures by a sum\\nof more than $45,000. That of the succeeding year has been still more\\nproductive. The increase of the receipts in the year preceding the\\nfirst of July last over that of the year before exceeds $136,000, and\\nthe excess of the receipts over the expenditures of the year has\\nswollen from $45,000 to yearly $80,000.\\n\\nDuring the same period contracts for additional transportation of the\\nmail in stages for about 260,000 miles have been made, and for 70,000\\nmiles annually on horse back. 714 new post offices have been\\nestablished within the year, and the increase of revenue within the\\nlast three years, as well as the augmentation of the transportation by\\nmail, is more than equal to the whole amount of receipts and of mail\\nconveyance at the commencement of the present century, when the seat of\\nthe General Government was removed to this place. When we reflect that\\nthe objects effected by the transportation of the mail are among the\\nchoicest comforts and enjoyments of social life, it is pleasing to\\nobserve that the dissemination of them to every corner of our country\\nhas out-stripped in their increase even the rapid march of our\\npopulation.\\n\\nBy the treaties with France and Spain, respectively ceding Louisiana\\nand the Floridas to the United States, provision was made for the\\nsecurity of land titles derived from the Governments of those nations.\\nSome progress has been made under the authority of various acts of\\nCongress in the ascertainment and establishment of those titles, but\\nclaims to a very large extent remain unadjusted. The public faith no\\nless than the just rights of individuals and the interest of the\\ncommunity itself appears to require further provision for the speedy\\nsettlement of those claims, which I therefore recommend to the care and\\nattention of the Legislature.\\n\\nIn conformity with the provisions of the act of May 20th, 1825, to\\nprovide for erecting a penitentiary in the District of Columbia, and\\nfor other purposes, three commissioners were appointed to select a site\\nfor the erection of a penitentiary for the District, and also a site in\\nthe county of Alexandria for a county jail, both of which objects have\\nbeen effected. The building of the penitentiary has been commenced, and\\nis in such a degree of forwardness as to promise that it will be\\ncompleted before the meeting of the next Congress. This consideration\\npoints to the expediency of maturing at the present session a system\\nfor the regulation and government of the penitentiary, and of defining\\na system for the regulation and government of the penitentiary, and of\\ndefining the class of offenses which shall be punishable by confinement\\nin this edifice.\\n\\nIn closing this communication I trust that it will not be deemed\\ninappropriate to the occasion and purposes upon which we are here\\nassembled to indulge a momentary retrospect, combining in a single\\nglance the period of our origin as a national confederation with that\\nof our present existence, at the precise interval of half a century\\nfrom each other. Since your last meeting at this place the 50th\\nanniversary of the day when our independence was declared has been\\ncelebrated throughout our land, and on that day, while every heart was\\nbounding with joy and every voice was tuned to gratulation, amid the\\nblessings of freedom and independence which the sires of a former age\\nhad handed down to their children, two of the principal actors in that\\nsolemn scene--the hand that penned the ever memorable Declaration and\\nthe voice that sustained it in debate--were by one summons, at the\\ndistance of 700 miles from each other, called before the Judge of All\\nto account for their deeds done upon earth. They departed cheered by\\nthe benedictions of their country, to whom they left the inheritance of\\ntheir fame and the memory of their bright example.\\n\\nIf we turn our thoughts to the condition of their country, in the\\ncontrast of the first and last day of that half century, how\\nresplendent and sublime is the transition from gloom to glory! Then,\\nglancing through the same lapse of time, in the condition of the\\nindividuals we see the first day marked with the fullness and vigor of\\nyouth, in the pledge of their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred\\nhonor to the cause of freedom and of man-kind; and on the last,\\nextended on the bed of death, with but sense and sensibility left to\\nbreathe a last aspiration to Heaven of blessing upon their country, may\\nwe not humbly hope that to them too it was a pledge of transition from\\ngloom to glory, and that while their mortal vestments were sinking into\\nthe clod of the valley their emancipated spirits were ascending to the\\nbosom of their God!\\n\\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS\",\n",
       " 'Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nIt is with peculiar satisfaction that I meet the 6th Congress of the United\\nStates of America. Coming from all parts of the Union at this critical and\\ninteresting period, the members must be fully possessed of the sentiments\\nand wishes of our constituents.\\n\\nThe flattering prospects of abundance from the labors of the people by land\\nand by sea; the prosperity of our extended commerce, notwithstanding\\ninterruptions occasioned by the belligerent state of a great part of the\\nworld; the return of health, industry, and trade to those cities which have\\nlately been afflicted with disease, and the various and inestimable\\nadvantages, civil and religious, which, secured under our happy frame of\\ngovernment, are continued to us unimpaired, demand of the whole American\\npeople sincere thanks to a benevolent Deity for the merciful dispensations\\nof His providence.\\n\\nBut while these numerous blessings are recollected, it is a painful duty to\\nadvert to the ungrateful return which has been made for them by some of the\\npeople in certain counties of Pennsylvania, where, seduced by the arts and\\nmisrepresentations of designing men, they have openly resisted the law\\ndirecting the valuation of houses and lands. Such defiance was given to the\\ncivil authority as rendered hopeless all further attempts by judicial\\nprocess to enforce the execution of the law, and it became necessary to\\ndirect a military force to be employed, consisting of some companies of\\nregular troops, volunteers, and militia, by whose zeal and activity, in\\ncooperation with the judicial power, order and submission were restored and\\nmany of the offenders arrested. Of these, some have been convicted of\\nmisdemeanors, and others, charged with various crimes, remain to be tried.\\n\\nTo give due effect to the civil administration of Government and to insure\\na just execution of the laws, a revision and amendment of the judiciary\\nsystem is indispensably necessary. In this extensive country it can not but\\nhappen that numerous questions respecting the interpretation of the laws\\nand the rights and duties of officers and citizens must arise. On the one\\nhand, the laws should be executed; on the other, individuals should be\\nguarded from oppression. Neither of these objects is sufficiently assured\\nunder the present organization of the judicial department. I therefore\\nearnestly recommend the subject to your serious consideration.\\n\\nPersevering in the pacific and humane policy which had been invariably\\nprofessed and sincerely pursued by the Executive authority of the United\\nStates, when indications were made on the part of the French Republic of a\\ndisposition to accommodate the existing differences between the two\\ncountries, I felt it to be my duty to prepare for meeting their advances by\\na nomination of ministers upon certain conditions which the honor of our\\ncountry dictated, and which its moderation had given it a right to\\nprescribe.\\n\\nThe assurances which were required of the French Government previous to the\\ndeparture of our envoys have been given through their minister of foreign\\nrelations, and I have directed them to proceed on their mission to Paris.\\nThey have full power to conclude a treaty, subject to the constitutional\\nadvice and consent of the Senate. The characters of these gentlemen are\\nsure pledges to their country that nothing incompatible with its honor or\\ninterest, nothing inconsistent with our obligations of good faith or\\nfriendship to any other nation, will be stipulated.\\n\\nIt appearing probable from the information I received that our commercial\\nintercourse with some ports in the island of St. Domingo might safely be\\nrenewed, I took such steps as seemed to me expedient to ascertain that\\npoint. The result being satisfactory, I then, in conformity with the act of\\nCongress on the subject, directed the restraints and prohibitions of that\\nintercourse to be discontinued on terms which were made known by\\nproclamation. Since the renewal of this intercourse our citizens trading to\\nthose ports, with their property, have been duly respected, and\\nprivateering from those ports has ceased.\\n\\nIn examining the claims of British subjects by the commissioners at\\nPhiladelphia, acting under the 6th article of the treaty of amity,\\ncommerce, and navigation with Great Britain, a difference of opinion on\\npoints deemed essential in the interpretation of that article has arisen\\nbetween the commissioners appointed by the United States and the other\\nmembers of that board, from which the former have thought it their duty to\\nwithdraw. It is sincerely to be regretted that the execution of an article\\nproduced by a mutual spirit of amity and justice should have been thus\\nunavoidably interrupted. It is, however, confidently expected that the same\\nspirit of amity and the same sense of justice in which it originated will\\nlead to satisfactory explanations.\\n\\nIn consequence of the obstacles to the progress of the commission in\\nPhiladelphia, His Britannic Majesty has directed the commissioners\\nappointed by him under the 7th article of the treaty relating to the\\nBritish captures of American vessels to withdraw from the board sitting in\\nLondon, but with the express declaration of his determination to fulfill\\nwith punctuality and good faith the engagements which His Majesty has\\ncontracted by his treaty with the United States, and that they will be\\ninstructed to resume their functions whenever the obstacles which impede\\nthe progress of the commission at Philadelphia shall be removed. It being\\nin like manner my sincere determination, so far as the same depends on me,\\nthat with equal punctuality and good faith the engagements contracted by\\nthe United States in their treaties with His Britannic Majesty shall be\\nfulfilled, I shall immediately instruct our minister at London to endeavor\\nto obtain the explanation necessary to a just performance of those\\nengagements on the part of the United States. With such dispositions on\\nboth sides, I can not entertain a doubt that all difficulties will soon be\\nremoved and that the two boards will then proceed and bring the business\\ncommitted to them respectively to a satisfactory conclusion.\\n\\nThe act of Congress relative to the seat of the Government of the United\\nStates requiring that on the 1st Monday of December next it should be\\ntransferred from Philadelphia to the District chosen for its permanent\\nseat, it is proper for me to inform you that the commissioners appointed to\\nprovide suitable buildings for the accommodation of Congress and of the\\nPresident and of the public offices of the Government have made a report of\\nthe state of the buildings designed for those purposes in the city of\\nWashington, from which they conclude that the removal of the seat of\\nGovernment to that place at the time required will be practicable and the\\naccommodation satisfactory. Their report will be laid before you.\\n\\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nI shall direct the estimates of the appropriations necessary for the\\nservice of the ensuing year, together with an account of the revenue and\\nexpenditure, to be laid before you. During a period in which a great\\nportion of the civilized world has been involved in a war unusually\\ncalamitous and destructive, it was not to be expected that the United\\nStates could be exempted from extraordinary burthens. Although the period\\nis not arrived when the measures adopted to secure our country against\\nforeign attacks can be renounced, yet it is alike necessary for the honor\\nof the Government and the satisfaction of the community that an exact\\neconomy should be maintained. I invite you, gentlemen, to investigate the\\ndifferent branches of the public expenditure. The examination will lead to\\nbeneficial retrenchments or produce a conviction of the wisdom of the\\nmeasures to which the expenditure relates.\\n\\nGentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nAt a period like the present, when momentous changes are occurring and\\nevery hour is preparing new and great events in the political world, when a\\nspirit of war is prevalent in almost every nation with whose affairs the\\ninterests of the United States have any connection, unsafe and precarious\\nwould be our situation were we to neglect the means of maintaining our just\\nrights. The result of the mission to France is uncertain; but however it\\nmay terminate, a steady perseverance in a system of national defense\\ncommensurate with our resources and the situation of our country is an\\nobvious dictate of wisdom; for, remotely as we are placed from the\\nbelligerent nations, and desirous as we are, by doing justice to all, to\\navoid offense to any, nothing short of the power of repelling aggressions\\nwill secure to our country a rational prospect of escaping the calamities\\nof war or national degradation. As to myself, it is my anxious desire so to\\nexecute the trust reposed in me as to render the people of the United\\nStates prosperous and happy. I rely with entire confidence on your\\ncooperation in objects equally your care, and that our mutual labors will\\nserve to increase and confirm union among our fellow citizens and an\\nunshaken attachment to our Government.',\n",
       " 'Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nI was for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary, on account of\\nthe contagious sickness which afflicted the city of Philadelphia, to\\nconvene the National Legislature at some other place. This measure it was\\ndesirable to avoid, because it would occasion much public inconvenience and\\na considerable public expense and add to the calamities of the inhabitants\\nof this city, whose sufferings must have excited the sympathy of all their\\nfellow citizens. Therefore, after taking measures to ascertain the state\\nand decline of the sickness, I postponed my determination, having hopes,\\nnow happily realized, that, without hazard to the lives or health of the\\nmembers, Congress might assemble at this place, where it was next by law to\\nmeet. I submit, however, to your consideration whether a power to postpone\\nthe meeting of Congress, without passing the time fixed by the Constitution\\nupon such occasions, would not be a useful amendment to the law of 1794.\\n\\nAlthough I can not yet congratulate you on the reestablishment of peace in\\nEurope and the restoration of security to the persons and properties of our\\ncitizens from injustice and violence at sea, we have, nevertheless,\\nabundant cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence and influence for\\ninterior tranquillity and personal security, for propitious seasons,\\nprosperous agriculture, productive fisheries, and general improvements,\\nand, above all, for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and a\\ncalm but steady determination to support our sovereignty, as well as our\\nmoral and our religious principles, against all open and secret attacks.\\n\\nOur envoys extraordinary to the French Republic embarked--one in July, the\\nother in August--to join their colleague in Holland. I have received\\nintelligence of the arrival of both of them in Holland, from whence they\\nall proceeded on their journeys to Paris within a few days of the 19th of\\nSeptember. Whatever may be the result of this mission, I trust that nothing\\nwill have been omitted on my part to conduct the negotiation to a\\nsuccessful conclusion, on such equitable terms as may be compatible with\\nthe safety, honor and interest of the United States. Nothing, in the mean\\ntime, will contribute so much to the preservation of peace and the\\nattainment of justice as manifestation of that energy and unanimity of\\nwhich on many former occasions the people of the United States have given\\nsuch memorable proofs, and the exertion of those resources for national\\ndefense which a beneficent Providence has kindly placed within their\\npower.\\n\\nIt may be confidently asserted that nothing has occurred since the\\nadjournment of Congress which renders inexpedient those precautionary\\nmeasures recommended by me to the consideration of the two Houses at the\\nopening of your late extraordinary session. If that system was then\\nprudent, it is more so now, as increasing depredations strengthen the\\nreasons for its adoption.\\n\\nIndeed, whatever may be the issue of the negotiation with France, and\\nwhether the war in Europe is or is not to continue, I hold it most certain\\nthat permanent tranquillity and order will not soon be obtained. The state\\nof society has so long been disturbed, the sense of moral and religious\\nobligations so much weakened, public faith and national honor have been so\\nimpaired, respect to treaties has been so diminished, and the law of\\nnations has lost so much of its force, while pride, ambition, avarice and\\nviolence have been so long unrestrained, there remains no reasonable ground\\non which to raise an expectation that a commerce without protection or\\ndefense will not be plundered.\\n\\nThe commerce of the United States is essential, if not to their existence,\\nat least to their comfort, their growth, prosperity, and happiness. The\\ngenius, character, and habits of the people are highly commercial. Their\\ncities have been formed and exist upon commerce. Our agriculture,\\nfisheries, arts, and manufactures are connected with and depend upon it. In\\nshort, commerce has made this country what it is, and it can not be\\ndestroyed or neglected without involving the people in poverty and\\ndistress. Great numbers are directly and solely supported by navigation.\\nThe faith of society is pledged for the preservation of the rights of\\ncommercial and sea faring no less than of the other citizens. Under this\\nview of our affairs, I should hold myself guilty of a neglect of duty if I\\nforbore to recommend that we should make every exertion to protect our\\ncommerce and to place our country in a suitable posture of defense as the\\nonly sure means of preserving both.\\n\\nI have entertained an expectation that it would have been in my power at\\nthe opening of this session to have communicated to you the agreeable\\ninformation of the due execution of our treaty with His Catholic Majesty\\nrespecting the withdrawing of his troops from our territory and the\\ndemarcation of the line of limits, but by the latest authentic intelligence\\nSpanish garrisons were still continued within our country, and the running\\nof the boundary line had not been commenced. These circumstances are the\\nmore to be regretted as they can not fail to affect the Indians in a manner\\ninjurious to the United States. Still, however, indulging the hope that the\\nanswers which have been given will remove the objections offered by the\\nSpanish officers to the immediate execution of the treaty, I have judged it\\nproper that we should continue in readiness to receive the posts and to run\\nthe line of limits. Further information on this subject will be\\ncommunicated in the course of the session.\\n\\nIn connection with this unpleasant state of things on our western frontier\\nit is proper for me to mention the attempts of foreign agents to alienate\\nthe affections of the Indian nations and to excite them to actual\\nhostilities against the United States. Great activity has been exerted by\\nthose persons who have insinuated themselves among the Indian tribes\\nresiding within the territory of the United States to influence them to\\ntransfer their affections and force to a foreign nation, to form them into\\na confederacy, and prepare them for war against the United States. Although\\nmeasures have been taken to counteract these infractions of our rights, to\\nprevent Indian hostilities, and to preserve entire their attachment to the\\nUnited States, it is my duty to observe that to give a better effect to\\nthese measures and to obviate the consequences of a repetition of such\\npractices a law providing adequate punishment for such offenses may be\\nnecessary.\\n\\nThe commissioners appointed under the 5th article of the treaty of amity,\\ncommerce, and navigation between the United States and Great Britain to\\nascertain the river which was truly intended under the name of the river\\nSt. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace, met at Passamaquoddy Bay in\\n1796 October, and viewed the mouths of the rivers in question and the\\nadjacent shores and islands, and, being of opinion that actual surveys of\\nboth rivers to their sources were necessary, gave to the agents of the two\\nnations instructions for that purpose, and adjourned to meet at Boston in\\nAugust. They met, but the surveys requiring more time than had been\\nsupposed, and not being then completed, the commissioners again adjourned,\\nto meet at Providence, in the State of Rhode Island, in June next, when we\\nmay expect a final examination and decision.\\n\\nThe commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 6th article of the treaty\\nmet at Philadelphia in May last to examine the claims of British subjects\\nfor debts contracted before the peace and still remaining due to them from\\ncitizens or inhabitants of the United States. Various causes have hitherto\\nprevented any determinations, but the business is now resumed, and\\ndoubtless will be prosecuted without interruption.\\n\\nSeveral decisions on the claims of citizens of the United States for losses\\nand damages sustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures or\\ncondemnations of their vessels or other property have been made by the\\ncommissioners in London conformably to the 7th article of the treaty. The\\nsums awarded by the commissioners have been paid by the British Government.\\nA considerable number of other claims, where costs and damages, and not\\ncaptured property, were the only objects in question, have been decided by\\narbitration, and the sums awarded to the citizens of the United States have\\nalso been paid.\\n\\nThe commissioners appointed agreeably to the 21st article of our treaty\\nwith Spain met at Philadelphia in the summer past to examine and decide on\\nthe claims of our citizens for losses they have sustained in consequence of\\ntheir vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His Catholic\\nMajesty during the late war between Spain and France. Their sittings have\\nbeen interrupted, but are now resumed.\\n\\nThe United States being obligated to make compensation for the losses and\\ndamages sustained by British subjects, upon the award of the commissioners\\nacting under the 6th article of the treaty with Great Britain, and for the\\nlosses and damages sustained by British subjects by reason of the capture\\nof their vessels and merchandise taken within the limits and jurisdiction\\nof the United States and brought into their ports, or taken by vessels\\noriginally armed in ports of the United States, upon the awards of the\\ncommissioners acting under the 7th article of the same treaty, it is\\nnecessary that provision be made for fulfilling these obligations.\\n\\nThe numerous captures of American vessels by the cruisers of the French\\nRepublic and of some by those of Spain have occasioned considerable\\nexpenses in making and supporting the claims of our citizens before their\\ntribunals. The sums required for this purpose have in divers instances been\\ndisbursed by the consuls of the United States. By means of the same\\ncaptures great numbers of our sea men have been thrown ashore in foreign\\ncountries, destitute of all means of subsistence, and the sick in\\nparticular have been exposed to grievous sufferings. The consuls have in\\nthese cases also advanced moneys for their relief. For these advances they\\nreasonably expect reimbursements from the United States.\\n\\nThe consular act relative to sea men requires revision and amendment. The\\nprovisions for their support in foreign countries and for their return are\\nfound to be inadequate and ineffectual. Another provision seems necessary\\nto be added to the consular act. Some foreign vessels have been discovered\\nsailing under the flag of the United States and with forged papers. It\\nseldom happens that the consuls can detect this deception, because they\\nhave no authority to demand an inspection of the registers and sea\\nletters.\\n\\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nIt is my duty to recommend to your serious consideration those objects\\nwhich by the Constitution are placed particularly within your sphere--the\\nnational debts and taxes.\\n\\nSince the decay of the feudal system, by which the public defense was\\nprovided for chiefly at the expense of individuals, the system of loans has\\nbeen introduced, and as no nation can raise within the year by taxes\\nsufficient sums for its defense and military operations in time of war the\\nsums loaned and debts contracted have necessarily become the subjects of\\nwhat have been called funding systems. The consequences arising from the\\ncontinual accumulation of public debts in other countries ought to admonish\\nus to be careful to prevent their growth in our own. The national defense\\nmust be provided for as well as the support of Government; but both should\\nbe accomplished as much as possible by immediate taxes, and as little as\\npossible by loans.\\n\\nThe estimates for the service of the ensuing year will by my direction be\\nlaid before you.\\n\\nGentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nWe are met together at a most interesting period. The situations of the\\nprincipal powers of Europe are singular and portentous. Connected with some\\nby treaties and with all by commerce, no important event there can be\\nindifferent to us. Such circumstances call with peculiar importunity not\\nless for a disposition to unite in all those measures on which the honor,\\nsafety, and prosperity of our country depend than for all the exertions of\\nwisdom and firmness.\\n\\nIn all such measures you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence.',\n",
       " \"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nA revolution of the seasons has nearly been completed since the\\nrepresentatives of the people and States of this Union were last\\nassembled at this place to deliberate and to act upon the common\\nimportant interests of their constituents. In that interval the never\\nslumbering eye of a wise and beneficent Providence has continued its\\nguardian care over the welfare of our beloved country; the blessing of\\nhealth has continued generally to prevail throughout the land; the\\nblessing of peace with our brethren of the human race has been enjoyed\\nwithout interruption; internal quiet has left our fellow citizens in\\nthe full enjoyment of all their rights and in the free exercise of all\\ntheir faculties, to pursue the impulse of their nature and the\\nobligation of their duty in the improvement of their own condition; the\\nproductions of the soil, the exchanges of commerce, the vivifying\\nlabors of human industry, have combined to mingle in our cup a portion\\nof enjoyment as large and liberal as the indulgence of Heaven has\\nperhaps ever granted to the imperfect state of man upon earth; and as\\nthe purest of human felicity consists in its participation with others,\\nit is no small addition to the sum of our national happiness at this\\ntime that peace and prosperity prevail to a degree seldom experienced\\nover the whole habitable globe, presenting, though as yet with painful\\nexceptions, a foretaste of that blessed period of promise when the lion\\nshall lie down with the lamb and wars shall be no more.\\n\\nTo preserve, to improve, and to perpetuate the sources and to direct in\\ntheir most effective channels the streams which contribute to the\\npublic weal is the purpose for which Government was instituted. Objects\\nof deep importance to the welfare of the Union are constantly recurring\\nto demand the attention of the Federal Legislature, and they call with\\naccumulated interest at the first meeting of the two Houses after their\\nperiodical renovation. To present to their consideration from time to\\ntime subjects in which the interests of the nation are most deeply\\ninvolved, and for the regulation of which the legislative will is alone\\ncompetent, is a duty prescribed by the Constitution, to the performance\\nof which the first meeting of the new Congress is a period eminently\\nappropriate, and which it is now my purpose to discharge.\\n\\nOur relations of friendship with the other nations of the earth,\\npolitical and commercial, have been preserved unimpaired, and the\\nopportunities to improve them have been cultivated with anxious and\\nunremitting attention. A negotiation upon subjects of high and delicate\\ninterest with the Government of Great Britain has terminated in the\\nadjustment of some of the questions at issue upon satisfactory terms\\nand the postponement of others for future discussion and agreement.\\n\\nThe purposes of the convention concluded at St. Petersburg on July\\n12th, 1822, under the mediation of the late Emperor Alexander, have\\nbeen carried into effect by a subsequent convention, concluded at\\nLondon on November 13th, 1826, the ratifications of which were\\nexchanged at that place on February 6th, 1827. A copy of the\\nproclamations issued on March 19th, 1827, publishing this convention,\\nis herewith communicated to Congress. The sum of $1,204,960, therein\\nstipulated to be paid to the claimants of indemnity under the first\\narticle of the treaty of Ghent, has been duly received, and the\\ncommission instituted, conformably to the act of Congress of March 2d,\\n1827, for the distribution of the indemnity of the persons entitled to\\nreceive it are now in session and approaching the consummation of their\\nlabors. This final disposal of one of the most painful topics of\\ncollision between the United States and Great Britain not only affords\\nan occasion of gratulation to ourselves, but has had the happiest\\neffect in promoting a friendly disposition and in softening asperities\\nupon other objects of discussion; nor ought it to pass without the\\ntribute of a frank and cordial acknowledgment of the magnanimity with\\nwhich an honorable nation, by the reparation of their own wrongs,\\nachieves a triumph more glorious than any field of blood can ever\\nbestow.\\n\\nThe conventions of March 7th, 1815, and of October 20th, 1818, will\\nexpire by their own limitation on October 20th, 1828. These have\\nregulated the direct commercial intercourse between the United States\\nand Great Britain upon terms of the most perfect reciprocity; and they\\neffected a temporary compromise of the respective rights and claims to\\nterritory westward of the Rocky Mountains. These arrangements have been\\ncontinued for an indefinite period of time after the expiration of the\\nabove mentioned conventions, leaving each party the liberty of\\nterminating them by giving twelve months' notice to the other.\\n\\nThe radical principle of all commercial intercourse between independent\\nnations is the mutual interest of both parties. It is the vital spirit\\nof trade itself; nor can it be reconciled to the nature of man or to\\nthe primary laws of human society that any traffic should long be\\nwillingly pursued of which all the advantages are on one side and all\\nthe burdens on the other. Treaties of commerce have been found by\\nexperience to be among the most effective instruments for promoting\\npeace and harmony between nations whose interests, exclusively\\nconsidered on either side, are brought into frequent collisions by\\ncompetition. In framing such treaties it is the duty of each party not\\nsimply to urge with unyielding pertinacity that which suits its own\\ninterest, but to concede liberally to that which is adapted to the\\ninterest of the other.\\n\\nTo accomplish this, little more is generally required than a simple\\nobservance of the rule of reciprocity, and were it possible for the\\nstates-men of one nation by stratagem and management to obtain from\\nthe weakness or ignorance of another an over-reaching treaty, such a\\ncompact would prove an incentive to war rather than a bond of peace.\\n\\nOur conventions with Great Britain are founded upon the principles of\\nreciprocity. The commercial intercourse between the two countries is\\ngreater in magnitude and amount than between any two other nations on\\nthe globe. It is for all purposes of benefit or advantage to both as\\nprecious, and in all probability far more extensive, than if the\\nparties were still constituent parts of one and the same nation.\\nTreaties between such States, regulating the intercourse of peace\\nbetween them and adjusting interests of such transcendent importance to\\nboth, which have been found in a long experience of years mutually\\nadvantageous, should not be lightly cancelled or discontinued. Two\\nconventions for continuing in force those above mentioned have been\\nconcluded between the plenipotentiaries of the two Governments on\\nAugust 6th, 1827, and will be forthwith laid before the Senate for the\\nexercise of their constitutional authority concerning them.\\n\\nIn the execution of the treaties of peace of November, 1782 and\\nSeptember, 1783, between the United States and Great Britain, and which\\nterminated the war of our independence, a line of boundary was drawn as\\nthe demarcation of territory between the two countries, extending over\\nnearly 20 degrees of latitude, and ranging over seas, lakes, and\\nmountains, then very imperfectly explored and scarcely opened to the\\ngeographical knowledge of the age. In the progress of discovery and\\nsettlement by both parties since that time several questions of\\nboundary between their respective territories have arisen, which have\\nbeen found of exceedingly difficult adjustment.\\n\\nAt the close of the last war with Great Britain four of these questions\\npressed themselves upon the consideration of the negotiators of the\\ntreaty of Ghent, but without the means of concluding a definitive\\narrangement concerning them. They were referred to three separate\\ncommissions consisting, of two commissioners, one appointed by each\\nparty, to examine and decide upon their respective claims. In the event\\nof a disagreement between the commissioners, one appointed by each\\nparty, to examine and decide upon their respective claims. In the event\\nof a disagreement between the commissioners it was provided that they\\nshould make reports to their several Governments, and that the reports\\nshould finally be referred to the decision of a sovereign the common\\nfriend of both.\\n\\nOf these commissions two have already terminated their sessions and\\ninvestigations, one by entire and the other by partial agreement. The\\ncommissioners of the 5th article of the treaty of Ghent have finally\\ndisagreed, and made their conflicting reports to their own Governments.\\nBut from these reports a great difficulty has occurred in making up a\\nquestion to be decided by the arbitrator. This purpose has, however,\\nbeen effected by a 4th convention, concluded at London by the\\nplenipotentiaries of the two Governments on September 29th, 1827. It\\nwill be submitted, together with the others, to the consideration of\\nthe Senate.\\n\\nWhile these questions have been pending incidents have occurred of\\nconflicting pretensions and of dangerous character upon the territory\\nitself in dispute between the two nations. By a common understanding\\nbetween the Governments it was agreed that no exercise of exclusive\\njurisdiction by either party while the negotiation was pending should\\nchange the state of the question of right to be definitively settled.\\nSuch collision has, never the less, recently taken place by occurrences\\nthe precise character of which has not yet been ascertained. A\\ncommunication from the governor of the State of Maine, with\\naccompanying documents, and a correspondence between the Secretary of\\nState and the minister of Great Britain on this subject are now\\ncommunicated. Measures have been taken to ascertain the state of the\\nfacts more correctly by the employment of a special agent to visit the\\nspot where the alleged outrages have occurred, the result of those\\ninquiries, when received, will be transmitted to Congress.\\n\\nWhile so many of the subjects of high interest to the friendly\\nrelations between the two countries have been so far adjusted, it is a\\nmatter of regret that their views respecting the commercial intercourse\\nbetween the United States and the British colonial possessions have not\\nequally approximated to a friendly agreement.\\n\\nAt the commencement of the last session of Congress they were informed\\nof the sudden and unexpected exclusion by the British Government of\\naccess in vessels of the United States to all their colonial ports\\nexcept those immediately bordering upon our own territories. In the\\namicable discussions which have succeeded the adoption of this measure\\nwhich, as it affected harshly the interests of the United States,\\nbecame subject of expostulation on our part, the principles upon which\\nits justification has been placed have been of a diversified character.\\nIt has been at once ascribed to a mere recurrence to the old, long\\nestablished principle of colonial monopoly and at the same time to a\\nfeeling of resentment because the offers of an act of Parliament\\nopening the colonial ports upon certain conditions had not been grasped\\nat with sufficient eagerness by an instantaneous conformity to them.\\n\\nAt a subsequent period it has been intimated that the new exclusion was\\nin resentment because a prior act of Parliament, of 1822, opening\\ncertain colonial ports, under heavy and burdensome restrictions, to\\nvessels of the United States, had not been reciprocated by an admission\\nof British vessels from the colonies, and their cargoes, without any\\nrestriction or discrimination what ever. But be the motive for the\\ninterdiction what it may, the British Government have manifested no\\ndisposition, either by negotiation or by corresponding legislative\\nenactments, to recede from it, and we have been given distinctly to\\nunderstand that neither of the bills which were under the consideration\\nof Congress at their last session would have been deemed sufficient in\\ntheir concessions to have been rewarded by any relaxation from the\\nBritish interdict. It is one of the inconveniences inseparably\\nconnected with the attempt to adjust by reciprocal legislation\\ninterests of this nature that neither party can know what would be\\nsatisfactory to the other, and that after enacting a statute for the\\navowed and sincere purpose of conciliation it will generally be found\\nutterly inadequate to the expectation of the other party, and will\\nterminate in mutual disappointment.\\n\\nThe session of Congress having terminated without any act upon the\\nsubject, a proclamation was issued on March 17, 1827, conformably to\\nthe provisions of the 6th section of the act of March 3rd, 1823\\ndeclaring the fact that the trade and intercourse authorized by the\\nBritish act of Parliament of June 24th, 1822, between the United States\\nand the British enumerated colonial ports had been by the subsequent\\nacts of Parliament of July 5th, 1825, and the order of council of July\\n27th, 1826 prohibited. The effect of this proclamation, by the terms of\\nthe act under which it was issued, has been that each and every\\nprovision of the act concerning navigation of April 18th, 1818, and of\\nthe act supplementary thereto of May 15th, 1820, revived and is in full\\nforce.\\n\\nSuch, then is the present condition of the trade that, useful as it is\\nto both parties it can, with a single momentary exception, be carried\\non directly by the vessels of neither. That exception itself is found\\nin a proclamation of the governor of the island of St. Christopher and\\nof the Virgin Islands, inviting for three months from August 28th, 1827\\nthe importation of the articles of the produce of the United States\\nwhich constitute their export portion of this trade in the vessels of\\nall nations.\\n\\nThat period having already expired, the state of mutual interdiction\\nhas again taken place. The British Government have not only declined\\nnegotiation upon this subject, but by the principle they have assumed\\nwith reference to it have precluded even the means of negotiation. It\\nbecomes not the self respect of the United States either to solicit\\ngratuitous favors or to accept as the grant of a favor that for which\\nan ample equivalent is exacted. It remains to be determined by the\\nrespective Governments whether the trade shall be opened by acts of\\nreciprocal legislation. It is, in the mean time, satisfactory to know\\nthat apart from the inconvenience resulting from a disturbance of the\\nusual channels of trade no loss has been sustained by the commerce, the\\nnavigation, or the revenue of the United States, and none of magnitude\\nis to be apprehended from this existing state of mutual interdict.\\n\\nWith the other maritime and commercial nations of Europe our\\nintercourse continues with little variation. Since the cessation by the\\nconvention of June 24th, 1822, of all discriminating duties upon the\\nvessels of the United States and of France in either country our trade\\nwith that nation has increased and is increasing. A disposition on the\\npart of France has been manifested to renew that negotiation, and in\\nacceding to the proposal we have expressed the wish that it might be\\nextended to other subjects upon which a good understanding between the\\nparties would be beneficial to the interests of both.\\n\\nThe origin of the political relations between the United States and\\nFrance is coeval with the first years of our independence. The memory\\nof it is interwoven with that of our arduous struggle for national\\nexistence. Weakened as it has occasionally been since that time, it can\\nby us never be forgotten, and we should hail with exultation the moment\\nwhich should indicate a recollection equally friendly in spirit on the\\npart of France.\\n\\nA fresh effort has recently been made by the minister of the United\\nStates residing at Paris to obtain a consideration of the just claims\\nof citizens of the United States to the reparation of wrongs long since\\ncommitted, many of them frankly acknowledged and all of them entitled\\nupon every principle of justice to a candid examination. The proposal\\nlast made to the French Government has been to refer the subject which\\nhas formed an obstacle to this consideration to the determination of a\\nsovereign the common friend of both. To this offer no definitive answer\\nhas yet been received, but the gallant and honorable spirit which has\\nat all times been the pride and glory of France will not ultimately\\npermit the demands of innocent sufferers to be extinguished in the mere\\nconsciousness of the power to reject them.\\n\\nA new treaty of amity, navigation, and commerce has been concluded with\\nthe Kingdom of Sweden, which will be submitted to the Senate for their\\nadvice with regard to its ratification. At a more recent date a\\nminister plenipotentiary from the Hanseatic Republics of Hamburg,\\nLubeck, and Bremen has been received, charged with a special mission\\nfor the negotiation of a treaty of amity and commerce between that\\nancient and renowned league and the United States. This negotiation has\\naccordingly been commenced, and is now in progress, the result of which\\nwill, if successful, be also submitted to the Senate for their\\nconsideration.\\n\\nSince the accession of the Emperor Nicholas to the imperial throne of\\nall the Russias the friendly dispositions toward the United States so\\nconstantly manifested by his predecessor have continued unabated, and\\nhave been recently testified by the appointment of a minister\\nplenipotentiary to reside at this place. From the interest taken by\\nthis Sovereign in behalf of the suffering Greeks and from the spirit\\nwith which others of the great European powers are cooperating with him\\nthe friends of freedom and of humanity may indulge the hope that they\\nwill obtain relief from that most unequal of conflicts which they have\\nso long and so gallantly sustained; that they will enjoy the blessing\\nof self government, which by their sufferings in the cause of liberty\\nthey have richly earned, and that their independence will be secured by\\nthose liberal institutions of which their country furnished the\\nearliest examples in the history of man-kind, and which have\\nconsecrated to immortal remembrance the very soil for which they are\\nnow again profusely pouring forth their blood. The sympathies which the\\npeople and Government of the United States have so warmly indulged with\\ntheir cause have been acknowledged by their Government in a letter of\\nthanks, which I have received from their illustrious President, a\\ntranslation of which is now communicated to Congress, the\\nrepresentatives of that nation to whom this tribute of gratitude was\\nintended to be paid, and to whom it was justly due.\\n\\nIn the American hemisphere the cause of freedom and independence has\\ncontinued to prevail, and if signalized by none of those splendid\\ntriumphs which had crowned with glory some of the preceding years it\\nhas only been from the banishment of all external force against which\\nthe struggle had been maintained. The shout of victory has been\\nsuperseded by the expulsion of the enemy over whom it could have been\\nachieved.\\n\\nOur friendly wishes and cordial good will, which have constantly\\nfollowed the southern nations of America in all the vicissitudes of\\ntheir war of independence, are succeeded by a solicitude equally ardent\\nand cordial that by the wisdom and purity of their institutions they\\nmay secure to themselves the choicest blessings of social order and the\\nbest rewards of virtuous liberty. Disclaiming alike all right and all\\nintention of interfering in those concerns which it is the prerogative\\nof their independence to regulate as to them shall seem fit, we hail\\nwith joy every indication of their prosperity, of their harmony, of\\ntheir persevering and inflexible homage to those principles of freedom\\nand of equal rights which are alone suited to the genius and temper of\\nthe American nations.\\n\\nIt has been, therefore, with some concern that we have observed\\nindications of intestine divisions in some of the Republics of the\\nsouth, and appearances of less union with one another than we believe\\nto be the interest of all. Among the results of this state of things\\nhas been that the treaties concluded at Panama do not appear to have\\nbeen ratified by the contracting parties, and that the meeting of the\\ncongress at Tacubaya has been indefinitely postponed. In accepting the\\ninvitations to be represented at this congress, while a manifestation\\nwas intended on the part of the United States of the most friendly\\ndisposition toward the southern Republics by whom it had been proposed,\\nit was hoped that it would furnish an opportunity for bringing all the\\nnations of this hemisphere to the common acknowledgment and adoption of\\nthe principles in the regulation of their internal relations which\\nwould have secured a lasting peace and harmony between them and have\\npromoted the cause of mutual benevolence throughout the globe. But as\\nobstacles appear to have arisen to the reassembling of the congress,\\none of the two ministers commissioned on the part of the United States\\nhas returned to the bosom of his country, while the minister charged\\nwith the ordinary mission to Mexico remains authorized to attend the\\nconferences of the congress when ever they may be resumed.\\n\\nA hope was for a short time entertained that a treaty of peace actually\\nsigned between the Government of Buenos Ayres and of Brazil would\\nsupersede all further occasion for those collisions between belligerent\\npretensions and neutral rights which are so commonly the result of\\nmaritime war, and which have unfortunately disturbed the harmony of the\\nrelations between the United States and the Brazilian Governments. At\\ntheir last session Congress were informed that some of the naval\\nofficers of that Empire had advanced and practiced upon principles in\\nrelation to blockades and to neutral navigation which we could not\\nsanction, and which our commanders found it necessary to resist. It\\nappears that they have not been sustained by the Government of Brazil\\nitself. Some of the vessels captured under the assumed authority of\\nthese erroneous principles have been restored, and we trust that our\\njust expectations will be realized that adequate indemnity will be made\\nto all the citizens of the United States who have suffered by the\\nunwarranted captures which the Brazilian tribunals themselves have\\npronounced unlawful.\\n\\nIn the diplomatic discussions at Rio de Janeiro of these wrongs\\nsustained by citizens of the United States and of others which seemed\\nas if emanating immediately from that Government itself the charge\\nd'affaires of the United States, under an impression that his\\nrepresentations in behalf of the rights and interests of his country-\\nmen were totally disregarded and useless, deemed it his duty, without\\nwaiting for instructions, to terminate his official functions, to\\ndemand his pass-ports, and return to the United States. This movement,\\ndictated by an honest zeal for the honor and interests of his country--\\nmotives which operated exclusively on the mind of the officer who\\nresorted to it--has not been disapproved by me.\\n\\nThe Brazilian Government, however, complained of it as a measure for\\nwhich no adequate intentional cause had been given by them, and upon an\\nexplicit assurance through their charge d'affaires residing here that a\\nsuccessor to the late representative of the United States near that\\nGovernment, the appointment of whom they desired, should be received\\nand treated with the respect due to his character, and that indemnity\\nshould be promptly made for all injuries inflicted on citizens of the\\nUnited States or their property contrary to the laws of nations, a\\ntemporary commission as charge d'affaires to that country has been\\nissued, which it is hopes will entirely restore the ordinary diplomatic\\nintercourse between the two Governments and the friendly relations\\nbetween their respective nations.\\n\\nTurning from the momentous concerns of our Union in its intercourse\\nwith foreign nations to those of the deepest interest in the\\nadministration of our internal affairs, we find the revenues of the\\npresent year corresponding as nearly as might be expected with the\\nanticipations of the last, and presenting an aspect still more\\nfavorable in the promise of the next.\\n\\nThe balance in the Treasury on January 1st, 1827 was $6,358,686.18. The\\nreceipts from that day to September 30th, 1827, as near as the returns\\nof them yet received can show, amount to $16,886,581.32. The receipts\\nof the present quarter, estimated at $4,515,000, added to the above\\nform an aggregate of $21,400,000 of receipts.\\n\\nThe expenditures of the year may perhaps amount to $22,300,000\\npresenting a small excess over the receipts. But of these $22,000,000,\\nupward of $6,000,000 have been applied to the discharge of the\\nprincipal of the public debt, the whole amount of which, approaching\\n$74,000,000 on January 1st, 1827, will on January 1st, 1828 fall short\\nof $67,500,000. The balance in the Treasury on January 1st, 1828 it is\\nexpected will exceed $5,450,000, a sum exceeding that of January 1st,\\n1825, though falling short of that exhibited on January 1st, 1827.\\n\\nIt was foreseen that the revenue of the present year 1827 would not\\nequal that of the last, which had itself been less than that of the\\nnext preceding year. But the hope has been realized which was\\nentertained, that these deficiencies would in no wise interrupt the\\nsteady operation of the discharge of the public debt by the annual\\n$10,000,000 devoted to that object by the act of March 3d, 1817.\\n\\nThe amount of duties secured on merchandise imported from the\\ncommencement of the year until September 30th, 1827 is $21,226,000, and\\nthe probably amount of that which will be secured during the remainder\\nof the year is $5,774,000, forming a sum total of $27,000,000. With the\\nallowances for draw-backs and contingent deficiencies which may occur,\\nthough not specifically foreseen, we may safely estimate the receipts\\nof the ensuing year at $22,300,000--a revenue for the next equal to the\\nexpenditure of the present year.\\n\\nThe deep solicitude felt by our citizens of all classes throughout the\\nUnion for the total discharge of the public debt will apologize for the\\nearnestness with which I deem it my duty to urge this topic upon the\\nconsideration of Congress--of recommending to them again the observance\\nof the strictest economy in the application of the public funds. The\\ndepression upon the receipts of the revenue which had commenced with\\nthe year 1826 continued with increased severity during the two first\\nquarters of the present year.\\n\\nThe returning tide began to flow with the third quarter, and, so far as\\nwe can judge from experience, may be expected to continue through the\\ncourse of the ensuing year. In the mean time an alleviation from the\\nburden of the public debt will in the three years have been effected to\\nthe amount of nearly $16,000,000, and the charge of annual interest\\nwill have been reduced upward of $1,000,000. But among the maxims of\\npolitical economy which the stewards of the public moneys should never\\nsuffer without urgent necessity to be transcended is that of keeping\\nthe expenditures of the year within the limits of its receipts.\\n\\nThe appropriations of the two last years, including the yearly\\n$10,000,000 of the sinking fund, have each equaled the promised revenue\\nof the ensuing year. While we foresee with confidence that the public\\ncoffers will be replenished from the receipts as fast as they will be\\ndrained by the expenditures, equal in amount to those of the current\\nyear, it should not be forgotten that they could ill suffer the\\nexhaustion of larger disbursements.\\n\\nThe condition of the Army and of all the branches of the public service\\nunder the superintendence of the Secretary of War will be seen by the\\nreport from that officer and the documents with which it is\\naccompanied.\\n\\nDuring the last summer a detachment of the Army has been usefully and\\nsuccessfully called to perform their appropriate duties. At the moment\\nwhen the commissioners appointed for carrying into execution certain\\nprovisions of the treaty of August 19th, 1825, with various tribes of\\nthe North Western Indians were about to arrive at the appointed place\\nof meeting the unprovoked murder of several citizens and other acts of\\nunequivocal hostility committed by a party of the Winnebago tribe, one\\nof those associated in the treaty, followed by indications of a\\nmenacing character among other tribes of the same region, rendered\\nnecessary an immediate display of the defensive and protective force of\\nthe Union in that quarter.\\n\\nIt was accordingly exhibited by the immediate and concerted movements\\nof the governors of the State of Illinois and of the Territory of\\nMichigan, and competent levies of militia, under their authority, with\\na corps of 700 men of United States troops, under the command of\\nGeneral Atkinson, who, at the call of Governor Cass, immediately\\nrepaired to the scene of danger from their station at St. Louis. Their\\npresence dispelled the alarms of our fellow citizens on those\\ndisorders, and overawed the hostile purposes of the Indians. The\\nperpetrators of the murders were surrendered to the authority and\\noperation of our laws, and every appearance of purposed hostility from\\nthose Indian tribes has subsided.\\n\\nAlthough the present organization of the Army and the administration of\\nits various branches of service are, upon the whole, satisfactory, they\\nare yet susceptible of much improvement in particulars, some of which\\nhave been heretofore submitted to the consideration of Congress, and\\nothers are now first presented in the report of the Secretary of War.\\n\\nThe expediency of providing for additional numbers of officers in the\\ntwo corps of engineers will in some degree depend upon the number and\\nextent of the objects of national importance upon which Congress may\\nthink it proper that surveys should be made conformably to the act of\\nApril 30th, 1824. Of the surveys which before the last session of\\nCongress had been made under the authority of that act, reports were\\nmade--Of the Board of Internal Improvement, on the Chesapeake and Ohio\\nCanal. On the continuation of the national road from Cumberland to the\\ntide waters within the District of Columbia. On the continuation of the\\nnational road from Canton to Zanesville. On the location of the\\nnational road from Zanesville to Columbus. On the continuation of the\\nsame to the seat of government in Missouri. On a post road from\\nBaltimore to Philadelphia. Of a survey of Kennebec River (in part). On\\na national road from Washington to Buffalo. On the survey of Saugatuck\\nHarbor and River. On a canal from Lake Pont Chartrain to the\\nMississippi River. On surveys at Edgartown, Newburyport, and Hyannis\\nHarbor. On survey of La Plaisance Bay, in the Territory of Michigan.\\nAnd reports are now prepared and will be submitted to Congress--On\\nsurveys of the peninsula of Florida, to ascertain the practicability of\\na canal to connect the waters of the Atlantic with the Gulf of Mexico\\nacross that peninsula; and also of the country between the bays of\\nMobile and of Pensacola, with the view of connecting them together by a\\ncanal. On surveys of a route for a canal to connect the waters of James\\nand Great Kenhawa rivers. On the survey of the Swash, in Pamlico Sound,\\nand that of Cape Fear, below the town of Wilmington, in North Carolina.\\nOn the survey of the Muscle Shoals, in the Tennessee River, and for a\\nroute for a contemplated communication between the Hiwassee and Coosa\\nrivers, in the State of Alabama. Other reports of surveys upon objects\\npointed out by the several acts of Congress of the last and preceding\\nsessions are in the progress of preparation, and most of them may be\\ncompleted before the close of this session. All the officers of both\\ncorps of engineers, with several other persons duly qualified, have\\nbeen constantly employed upon these services from the passage of the\\nact of April 30th, 1824, to this time.\\n\\nWere no other advantage to accrue to the country from their labors than\\nthe fund of topographical knowledge which they have collected and\\ncommunicated, that alone would have been a profit to the Union more\\nthan adequate to all the expenditures which have been devoted to the\\nobject; but the appropriations for the repair and continuation of the\\nCumberland road, for the construction of various other roads, for the\\nremoval of obstructions from the rivers and harbors, for the erection\\nof light houses, beacons, piers, and buoys, and for the completion of\\ncanals undertaken by individual associations, but needing the\\nassistance of means and resources more comprehensive than individual\\nenterprise can command, may be considered rather as treasures laid up\\nfrom the contributions of the present age for the benefit of posterity\\nthan as unrequited applications of the accruing revenues of the nation.\\n\\nTo such objects of permanent improvement to the condition of the\\ncountry, of real addition to the wealth as well as to the comfort of\\nthe people by whose authority and resources they have been effected,\\nfrom $3,000,000 to $4,000,000 of the annual income of the nation have,\\nby laws enacted at the three most recent sessions of Congress, been\\napplied, without intrenching upon the necessities of the Treasury,\\nwithout adding a dollar to the taxes or debts of the community, without\\nsuspending even the steady and regular discharge of the debts\\ncontracted in former days, which within the same three years have been\\ndiminished by the amount of nearly $16,000,000.\\n\\nThe same observations are in a great degree applicable to the\\nappropriations made for fortifications upon the coasts and harbors of\\nthe United States, for the maintenance of the Military Academy at West\\nPoint, and for the various objects under the superintendence of the\\nDepartment of the Navy. The report from the Secretary of the Navy and\\nthose from the subordinate branches of both the military departments\\nexhibit to Congress in minute detail the present condition of the\\npublic establishments dependent upon them, the execution of the acts of\\nCongress relating to them, and the views of the officers engaged in the\\nseveral branches of the service concerning the improvements which may\\ntend to their perfection.\\n\\nThe fortification of the coasts and the gradual increase and\\nimprovement of the Navy are parts of a great system of national defense\\nwhich has been upward of ten years in progress, and which for a series\\nof years to come will continue to claim the constant and persevering\\nprotection and superintendence of the legislative authority. Among the\\nmeasures which have emanated from these principles the act of the last\\nsession of Congress for the gradual improvement of the Navy holds a\\nconspicuous place. The collection of timber for the future construction\\nof vessels of war, the preservation and reproduction of the species of\\ntimber peculiarly adapted to that purpose, the construction of dry\\ndocks for the use of the Navy, the erection of a marine railway for the\\nrepair of the public ships, and the improvement of the navy yards for\\nthe preservation of the public property deposited in them have all\\nreceived from the Executive the attention required by that act, and\\nwill continue to receive it, steadily proceeding toward the execution\\nof all its purposes.\\n\\nThe establishment of a naval academy, furnishing the means of theoretic\\ninstruction to the youths who devote their lives to the service of\\ntheir country upon the ocean, still solicits the sanction of the\\nLegislature. Practical seamanship and the art of navigation may be\\nacquired on the cruises of the squadrons which from time to time are\\ndispatched to distant seas, but a competent knowledge even of the art\\nof ship building, the higher mathematics, and astronomy; the literature\\nwhich can place our officers on a level of polished education with the\\nofficers of other maritime nations; the knowledge of the laws,\\nmunicipal and national, which in their intercourse with foreign states\\nand their governments are continually called into operation, and, above\\nall, that acquaintance with the principles of honor and justice, with\\nthe higher obligations of morals and of general laws, human and divine,\\nwhich constitutes the great distinction between the warrior-patriot and\\nthe licensed robber and pirate--these can be systematically taught and\\neminently acquired only in a permanent school, stationed upon the shore\\nand provided with the teachers, the instruments, and the books\\nconversant with and adapted to the communication of the principles of\\nthese respective sciences to the youthful and inquiring mind.\\n\\nThe report from the Post Master General exhibits the condition of that\\nDepartment as highly satisfactory for the present and still more\\npromising for the future. Its receipts for the year ending July 1st,\\n1827 amounted to $1,473,551, and exceeded its expenditures by upward of\\n$100,000. It can not be an over sanguine estimate to predict that in\\nless than ten years, of which half have elapsed, the receipts will have\\nbeen more than doubled.\\n\\nIn the mean time a reduced expenditure upon established routes has kept\\npace with increased facilities of public accommodation and additional\\nservices have been obtained at reduced rates of compensation. Within\\nthe last year the transportation of the mail in stages has been greatly\\naugmented. The number of post offices has been increased to 7,000, and\\nit may be anticipated that while the facilities of intercourse between\\nfellow citizens in person or by correspondence will soon be carried to\\nthe door of every villager in the Union, a yearly surplus of revenue\\nwill accrue which may be applied as the wisdom of Congress under the\\nexercise of their constitutional powers may devise for the further\\nestablishment and improvement of the public roads, or by adding still\\nfurther to the facilities in the transportation of the mails. Of the\\nindications of the prosperous condition of our country, none can be\\nmore pleasing than those presented by the multiplying relations of\\npersonal and intimate intercourse between the citizens of the Union\\ndwelling at the remotest distances from each other.\\n\\nAmong the subjects which have heretofore occupied the earnest\\nsolicitude and attention of Congress is the management and disposal of\\nthat portion of the property of the nation which consists of the public\\nlands. The acquisition of them, made at the expense of the whole Union,\\nnot only in treasury but in blood, marks a right of property in them\\nequally extensive. By the report and statements from the General Land\\nOffice now communicated it appears that under the present Government of\\nthe United States a sum little short of $33,000,000 has been paid from\\nthe common Treasury for that portion of this property which has been\\npurchased from France and Spain, and for the extinction of the\\naboriginal titles. The amount of lands acquired is near 260,000,000\\nacres, of which on January 1st, 1826, about 139,000,000 acres had been\\nsurveyed, and little more than 19,000,000 acres had been sold. The\\namount paid into the Treasury by the purchasers of the public lands\\nsold is not yet equal to the sums paid for the whole, but leaves a\\nsmall balance to be refunded. The proceeds of the sales of the lands\\nhave long been pledged to the creditors of the nation, a pledge from\\nwhich we have reason to hope that they will in a very few years be\\nredeemed.\\n\\nThe system upon which this great national interest has been managed was\\nthe result of long, anxious, and persevering deliberation. Matured and\\nmodified by the progress of our population and the lessons of\\nexperience, it has been hitherto eminently successful. More than nine\\ntenths of the lands still remain the common property of the Union, the\\nappropriation and disposal of which are sacred trusts in the hands of\\nCongress.\\n\\nOf the lands sold, a considerable part were conveyed under extended\\ncredits, which in the vicissitudes and fluctuations in the value of\\nlands and of their produce became oppressively burdensome to the\\npurchasers. It can never be the interest or the policy of the nation to\\nwring from its own citizens the reasonable profits of their industry\\nand enterprise by holding them to the rigorous import of disastrous\\nengagements. In March, 1821, a debt of $22,000,000, due by purchasers\\nof the public lands, had accumulated, which they were unable to pay. An\\nact of Congress of March 2nd, 1821, came to their relief, and has been\\nsucceeded by others, the latest being the act of May 4th, 1826, the\\nindulgent provisions of which expired on July 4th, 1827. The effect of\\nthese laws has been to reduce the debt from the purchasers to a\\nremaining balance of about $4,300,000 due, more than three fifths of\\nwhich are for lands within the State of Alabama. I recommend to\\nCongress the revival and continuance for a further term of the\\nbeneficent accommodations to the public debtors of that statute, and\\nsubmit to their consideration, in the same spirit of equity, the\\nremission, under proper discriminations, of the forfeitures of partial\\npayments on account of purchases of the public lands, so far as to\\nallow of their application to other payments.\\n\\nThere are various other subjects of deep interest to the whole Union\\nwhich have heretofore been recommended to the consideration of\\nCongress, as well by my predecessors as, under the impression of the\\nduties devolving upon me, by myself. Among these are the debt, rather\\nof justice than gratitude, to the surviving warriors of the\\nRevolutionary war; the extension of the judicial administration of the\\nFederal Government to those extensive since the organization of the\\npresent judiciary establishment, now constitute at least one third of\\nits territory, power, and population; the formation of a more effective\\nand uniform system for the government of the militia, and the\\namelioration in some form or modification of the diversified and often\\noppressive codes relating to insolvency. Amidst the multiplicity of\\ntopics of great national concernment which may recommend themselves to\\nthe calm and patriotic deliberations of the Legislature, it may suffice\\nto say that on these and all other measures which may receive their\\nsanction my hearty cooperation will be given, conformably to the duties\\nenjoined upon me and under the sense of all the obligations prescribed\\nby the Constitution.\\n\\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS\",\n",
       " 'Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nIn taking a general survey of the concerns of our beloved country, with\\nreference to subjects interesting to the common welfare, the first\\nsentiment which impresses itself upon the mind is of gratitude to the\\nOmnipotent Disposer of All Good for the continuance of the signal\\nblessings of His providence, and especially for that health which to an\\nunusual extent has prevailed within our borders, and for that abundance\\nwhich in the vicissitudes of the seasons has been scattered with\\nprofusion over our land. Nor ought we less to ascribe to Him the glory\\nthat we are permitted to enjoy the bounties of His hand in peace and\\ntranquillity--in peace with all the other nations of the earth, in\\ntranquillity among our selves. There has, indeed, rarely been a period\\nin the history of civilized man in which the general condition of the\\nChristian nations has been marked so extensively by peace and\\nprosperity.\\n\\nEurope, with a few partial and unhappy exceptions, has enjoyed ten\\nyears of peace, during which all her Governments, what ever the theory\\nof their constitutions may have been, are successively taught to feel\\nthat the end of their institution is the happiness of the people, and\\nthat the exercise of power among men can be justified only by the\\nblessings it confers upon those over whom it is extended.\\n\\nDuring the same period our intercourse with all those nations has been\\npacific and friendly; it so continues. Since the close of your last\\nsession no material variation has occurred in our relations with any\\none of them. In the commercial and navigation system of Great Britain\\nimportant changes of municipal regulation have recently been sanctioned\\nby acts of Parliament, the effect of which upon the interests of other\\nnations, and particularly upon ours, has not yet been fully developed.\\nIn the recent renewal of the diplomatic missions on both sides between\\nthe two Governments assurances have been given and received of the\\ncontinuance and increase of the mutual confidence and cordiality by\\nwhich the adjustment of many points of difference had already been\\neffected, and which affords the surest pledge for the ultimate\\nsatisfactory adjustment of those which still remain open or may\\nhereafter arise.\\n\\nThe policy of the United States in their commercial intercourse with\\nother nations has always been of the most liberal character. In the\\nmutual exchange of their respective productions they have abstained\\naltogether from prohibitions; they have interdicted themselves the\\npower of laying taxes upon exports, and when ever they have favored\\ntheir own shipping by special preferences or exclusive privileges in\\ntheir own ports it has been only with a view to countervail similar\\nfavors and exclusions granted by the nations with whom we have been\\nengaged in traffic to their own people or shipping, and to the\\ndisadvantage of ours. Immediately after the close of the last war a\\nproposal was fairly made by the act of Congress of March 3rd, 1815, to\\nall the maritime nations to lay aside the system of retaliating\\nrestrictions and exclusions, and to place the shipping of both parties\\nto the common trade on a footing of equality in respect to the duties\\nof tonnage and impost. This offer was partially and successively\\naccepted by Great Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands, the Hanseatic\\ncities, Prussia, Sardinia, the Duke of Oldenburg, and Russia. It was\\nalso adopted, under certain modifications, in our late commercial\\nconvention with France, and by the act of Congress of January 1st,\\n1824, it has received a new confirmation with all the nations who had\\nacceded to it, and has been offered again to all those who are or may\\nhere after be willing to abide in reciprocity by it. But all these\\nregulations, whether established by treaty or by municipal enactments,\\nare still subject to one important restriction.\\n\\nThe removal of discriminating duties of tonnage and of impost is\\nlimited to articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of the\\ncountry to which the vessel belongs or to such articles as are most\\nusually first shipped from her ports. It will deserve the serious\\nconsideration of Congress whether even this remnant of restriction may\\nnot be safely abandoned, and whether the general tender of equal\\ncompetition made in the act of January 8th, 1824, maynot be extended to\\ninclude all articles of merchandise not prohibited, of what country so\\never they may be the produce or manufacture. Propositions of this\\neffect have already been made to us by more than one European\\nGovernment, and it is probable that if once established by legislation\\nor compact with any distinguished maritime state it would recommend\\nitself by the experience of its advantages to the general accession of\\nall.\\n\\nThe convention of commerce and navigation between the United States and\\nFrance, concluded on June 24th, 1822, was, in the understanding and\\nintent of both parties, as appears upon its face, only a temporary\\narrangement of the points of difference between them of the most\\nimmediate and pressing urgency. It was limited in the first instance to\\ntwo years from January 10th, 1822, but with a proviso that it should\\nfurther continue in force \\'til the conclusion of a general and\\ndefinitive treaty of commerce, unless terminated by a notice, six\\nmonths in advance, of either of the parties to the other. Its operation\\nso far as it extended has been mutually advantageous, and it still\\ncontinues in force by common consent. But it left unadjusted several\\nobjects of great interest to the citizens and subjects of both\\ncountries, and particularly a mass of claims to considerable amount of\\ncitizens of the United States upon the Government of France of\\nindemnity for property taken or destroyed under circumstances of the\\nmost aggravated and outrageous character. In the long period during\\nwhich continual and earnest appeals have been made to the equity and\\nmagnanimity of France in behalf of these claims their justice has not\\nbeen, as it could not be, denied.\\n\\nIt was hoped that the accession of a new Sovereign to the throne would\\nhave afforded a favorable opportunity for presenting them to the\\nconsideration of his Government. They have been presented and urged\\nhither to without effect. The repeated and earnest representations of\\nour minister at the Court of France remain as yet even without an\\nanswer. Were the demands of nations upon the justice of each other\\nsusceptible of adjudication by the sentence of an impartial tribunal,\\nthose to which I now refer would long since have been settled and\\nadequate indemnity would have been obtained.\\n\\nThere are large amounts of similar claims upon the Netherlands, Naples,\\nand Denmark. For those upon Spain prior to 1819 indemnity was, after\\nmany years of patient forbearance, obtained; and those upon Sweden have\\nbeen lately compromised by a private settlement, in which the claimants\\nthemselves have acquiesced. The Governments of Denmark and of Naples\\nhave been recently reminded of those yet existing against them, nor\\nwill any of them be forgotten while a hope may be indulged of obtaining\\njustice by the means within the constitutional power of the Executive,\\nand without resorting to those means of self-redress which, as well as\\nthe time, circumstances, and occasion which may require them, are\\nwithin the exclusive competency of the Legislature.\\n\\nIt is with great satisfaction that I am enabled to bear witness to the\\nliberal spirit with which the Republic of Colombia has made\\nsatisfaction for well-established claims of a similar character, and\\namong the documents now communicated to Congress will be distinguished\\na treaty of commerce and navigation with that Republic, the\\nratifications of which have been exchanged since the last recess of the\\nLegislature. The negotiation of similar treaties with all of the\\nindependent South American States has been contemplated and may yet be\\naccomplished. The basis of them all, as proposed by the United States,\\nhas been laid in two principles--the one of entire and unqualified\\nreciprocity, the other the mutual obligation of the parties to place\\neach other permanently upon the footing of the most favored nation.\\nThese principles are, indeed, indispensable to the effectual\\nemancipation of the American hemisphere from the thralldom of\\ncolonizing monopolies and exclusions, an event rapidly realizing in the\\nprogress of human affairs, and which the resistance still opposed in\\ncertain parts of Europe to the acknowledgment of the Southern American\\nRepublics as independent States will, it is believed, contribute more\\neffectually to accomplish. The time has been, and that not remote, when\\nsome of those States might, in their anxious desire to obtain a nominal\\nrecognition, have accepted of a nominal independence, clogged with\\nburdensome conditions, and exclusive commercial privileges granted to\\nthe nation from which they have separated to the disadvantage of all\\nothers. They are all now aware that such concessions to any European\\nnation would be incompatible with that independence which they have\\ndeclared and maintained.\\n\\nAmong the measures which have been suggested to them by the new\\nrelations with one another, resulting from the recent changes in their\\ncondition, is that of assembling at the Isthmus of Panama a congress,\\nat which each of them should be represented, to deliberate upon objects\\nimportant to the welfare of all. The Republics of Colombia, of Mexico,\\nand of Central America have already deputed plenipotentiaries to such a\\nmeeting, and they have invited the United States to be also represented\\nthere by their ministers. The invitation has been accepted, and\\nministers on the part of the United States will be commissioned to\\nattend at those deliberations, and to take part in them so far as may\\nbe compatible with that neutrality from which it is neither our\\nintention nor the desire of the other American States that we should\\ndepart.\\n\\nThe commissioners under the 7th article of the treaty of Ghent have so\\nnearly completed their arduous labors that, by the report recently\\nreceived from the agent on the part of the United States, there is\\nreason to expect that the commission will be closed at their next\\nsession, appointed for May 22 of the ensuing year.\\n\\nThe other commission, appointed to ascertain the indemnities due for\\nslaves carried away from the United States after the close of the late\\nwar, have met with some difficulty, which has delayed their progress in\\nthe inquiry. A reference has been made to the British Government on the\\nsubject, which, it may be hoped, will tend to hasten the decision of\\nthe commissioners, or serve as a substitute for it.\\n\\nAmong the powers specifically granted to Congress by the Constitution\\nare those of establishing uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies\\nthroughout the United States and of providing for organizing, arming,\\nand disciplining the militia and for governing such part of them as may\\nbe employed in the services of the United States. The magnitude and\\ncomplexity of the interests affected by legislation upon these subjects\\nmay account for the fact that, long and often as both of them have\\noccupied the attention and animated the debates of Congress, no systems\\nhave yet been devised for fulfilling to the satisfaction of the\\ncommunity the duties prescribed by these grants of power.\\n\\nTo conciliate the claim of the individual citizen to the enjoyment of\\npersonal liberty, with the effective obligation of private contracts,\\nis the difficult problem to be solved by a law of bankruptcy. These are\\nobjects of the deepest interest to society, affecting all that is\\nprecious in the existence of multitudes of persons, many of them in the\\nclasses essentially dependent and helpless, of the age requiring\\nnurture, and of the sex entitled to protection from the free agency of\\nthe parent and the husband. The organization of the militia is yet more\\nindispensable to the liberties of the country. It is only by an\\neffective militia that we can at once enjoy the repose of peace and bid\\ndefiance to foreign aggression; it is by the militia that we are\\nconstituted an armed nation, standing in perpetual panoply of defense\\nin the presence of all the other nations of the earth. To this end it\\nwould be necessary, if possible, so to shape its organization as to\\ngive it a more united and active energy. There are laws establishing an\\nuniform militia throughout the United States and for arming and\\nequipping its whole body. But it is a body of dislocated members,\\nwithout the vigor of unity and having little of uniformity but the\\nname. To infuse into this most important institution the power of which\\nit is susceptible and to make it available for the defense of the Union\\nat the shortest notice and at the smallest expense possible of time, of\\nlife, and of treasure are among the benefits to be expected from the\\npersevering deliberations of Congress.\\n\\nAmong the unequivocal indications of our national prosperity is the\\nflourishing state of our finances. The revenues of the present year,\\nfrom all their principal sources, will exceed the anticipations of the\\nlast. The balance in the Treasury on the first of January last was a\\nlittle short of $2,000,000, exclusive of $2,500,000, being the moiety\\nof the loan of $5,000,000 authorized by the act of May 26th, 1824. The\\nreceipts into the Treasury from the first of January to the 30th of\\nSeptember, exclusive of the other moiety of the same loan, are\\nestimated at $16,500,000, and it is expected that those of the current\\nquarter will exceed $5,000,000, forming an aggregate of receipts of\\nnearly $22,000,000, independent of the loan. The expenditures of the\\nyear will not exceed that sum more than $2,000,000. By those\\nexpenditures nearly $8,000,000 of the principal of the public debt that\\nhave been discharged.\\n\\nMore than $1,500,000 has been devoted to the debt of gratitude to the\\nwarriors of the Revolution; a nearly equal sum to the construction of\\nfortifications and the acquisition of ordnance and other permanent\\npreparations of national defense; $500,000 to the gradual increase of\\nthe Navy; an equal sum for purchases of territory from the Indians and\\npayment of annuities to them; and upward of $1,000,000 for objects of\\ninternal improvement authorized by special acts of the last Congress.\\nIf we add to these $4,000,000 for payment of interest upon the public\\ndebt, there remains a sum of $7,000,000, which have defrayed the whole\\nexpense of the administration of Government in its legislative,\\nexecutive, and judiciary departments, including the support of the\\nmilitary and naval establishments and all the occasional contingencies\\nof a government coextensive with the Union.\\n\\nThe amount of duties secured on merchandise imported since the\\ncommencement of the year is about $25,500,000, and that which will\\naccrue during the current quarter is estimated at $5,500,000; from\\nthese $31,000,000, deducting the draw-backs, estimated at less than\\n$7,000,000, a sum exceeding $24,000,000 will constitute the revenue of\\nthe year, and will exceed the whole expenditures of the year. The\\nentire amount of the public debt remaining due on the first of January\\nnext will be short of $81,000,000.\\n\\nBy an act of Congress of the 3d of March last a loan of $12,000,000 was\\nauthorized at 4.5%, or an exchange of stock to that amount of 4.5% for\\na stock of 6%, to create a fund for extinguishing an equal amount of\\nthe public debt, bearing an interest of 6%, redeemable in 1826. An\\naccount of the measures taken to give effect to this act will be laid\\nbefore you by the Secretary of the Treasury. As the object which it had\\nin view has been but partially accomplished, it will be for the\\nconsideration of Congress whether the power with which it clothed the\\nExecutive should not be renewed at an early day of the present session,\\nand under what modifications.\\n\\nThe act of Congress of the 3d of March last, directing the Secretary of\\nthe Treasury to subscribe, in the name and for the use of the United\\nStates, for 1,500 shares of the capital stock of the Chesapeake and\\nDelaware Canal Company, has been executed by the actual subscription\\nfor the amount specified; and such other measures have been adopted by\\nthat officer, under the act, as the fulfillment of its intentions\\nrequires. The latest accounts received of this important undertaking\\nauthorize the belief that it is in successful progress.\\n\\nThe payments into the Treasury from the proceeds of the sales of the\\npublic lands during the present year were estimated at $1,000,000. The\\nactual receipts of the first two quarters have fallen very little short\\nof that sum; it is not expected that the second half of the year will\\nbe equally productive, but the income of the year from that source may\\nnow be safely estimated at $1,500,000. The act of Congress of May 18th,\\n1824, to provide for the extinguishment of the debt due to the United\\nStates by the purchasers of public lands, was limited in its operation\\nof relief to the purchaser to the 10th of April last. Its effect at the\\nend of the quarter during which it expired was to reduce that debt from\\n$10,000,000 to $7,000,000 By the operation of similar prior laws of\\nrelief, from and since that of March 2d, 1821, the debt had been\\nreduced from upward of $22,000,000 to $10,000,000.\\n\\nIt is exceedingly desirable that it should be extinguished altogether;\\nand to facilitate that consummation I recommend to Congress the revival\\nfor one year more of the act of May 18th, 1824, with such provisional\\nmodification as may be necessary to guard the public interests against\\nfraudulent practices in the resale of the relinquished land.\\n\\nThe purchasers of public lands are among the most useful of our fellow\\ncitizens, and since the system of sales for cash alone has been\\nintroduced great indulgence has been justly extended to those who had\\npreviously purchased upon credit. The debt which had been contracted\\nunder the credit sales had become unwieldy, and its extinction was\\nalike advantageous to the purchaser and to the public. Under the system\\nof sales, matured as it has been by experience, and adapted to the\\nexigencies of the times, the lands will continue as they have become,\\nan abundant source of revenue; and when the pledge of them to the\\npublic creditor shall have been redeemed by the entire discharge of the\\nnational debt, the swelling tide of wealth with which they replenish\\nthe common Treasury may be made to reflow in unfailing streams of\\nimprovement from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nThe condition of the various branches of the public service resorting\\nfrom the Department of War, and their administration during the current\\nyear, will be exhibited in the report of the Secretary of War and the\\naccompanying documents herewith communicated. The organization and\\ndiscipline of the Army are effective and satisfactory. To counteract\\nthe prevalence of desertion among the troops it has been suggested to\\nwithhold from the men a small portion of their monthly pay until the\\nperiod of their discharge; and some expedient appears to be necessary\\nto preserve and maintain among the officers so much of the art of\\nhorsemanship as could scarcely fail to be found wanting on the possible\\nsudden eruption of a war, which should take us unprovided with a single\\ncorps of cavalry.\\n\\nThe Military Academy at West Point, under the restrictions of a severe\\nbut paternal superintendence, recommends itself more and more to the\\npatronage of the nation, and the numbers of meritorious officers which\\nit forms and introduces to the public service furnishes the means of\\nmultiplying the undertakings of the public improvements to which their\\nacquirements at that institution are peculiarly adapted. The school of\\nartillery practice established at Fortress Monroe Hampton, Virginia is\\nwell suited to the same purpose, and may need the aid of further\\nlegislative provision to the same end. The reports of the various\\nofficers at the head of the administrative branches of the military\\nservice, connected with the quartering, clothing, subsistence, health,\\nand pay of the Army, exhibit the assiduous vigilance of those officers\\nin the performance of their respective duties, and the faithful\\naccountability which has pervaded every part of the system.\\n\\nOur relations with the numerous tribes of aboriginal natives of this\\ncountry, scattered over its extensive surface and so dependent even for\\ntheir existence upon our power, have been during the present year\\nhighly interesting. An act of Congress of May 25th, 1824, made an\\nappropriation to defray the expenses of making treaties of trade and\\nfriendship with the Indian tribes beyond the Mississippi. An act of\\nMarch 3d, 1825, authorized treaties to be made with the Indians for\\ntheir consent to the making of a road from the frontier of Missouri to\\nthat of New Mexico, and another act of the same date provided for\\ndefraying the expenses of holding treaties with the Sioux, Chippeways,\\nMenomenees, Sauks, Foxes, etc., for the purpose of establishing\\nboundaries and promoting peace between said tribes.\\n\\nThe first and last objects of these acts have been accomplished, and\\nthe second is yet in a process of execution. The treaties which since\\nthe last session of Congress have been concluded with the several\\ntribes will be laid before the Senate for their consideration\\nconformably to the Constitution. They comprise large and valuable\\nacquisitions of territory, and they secure an adjustment of boundaries\\nand give pledges of permanent peace between several tribes which had\\nbeen long waging bloody wars against each other.\\n\\nOn the 12th of February last a treaty was signed at the Indian Springs\\nbetween commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and\\ncertain chiefs and individuals of the Creek Nation of Indians, which\\nwas received at the seat of Government only a very few days before the\\nclose of the last session of Congress and of the late Administration.\\nThe advice and consent of the Senate was given to it on the 3d of\\nMarch, too late for it to receive the ratification of the then\\nPresident of the United States; it was ratified on the 7th of March,\\nunder the unsuspecting impression that it had been negotiated in good\\nfaith and in the confidence inspired by the recommendation of the\\nSenate. The subsequent transactions in relation to this treaty will\\nform the subject of a separate communication.\\n\\nThe appropriations made by Congress for public works, as well in the\\nconstruction of fortifications as for purposes of internal improvement,\\nso far as they have been expended, have been faithfully applied. Their\\nprogress has been delayed by the want of suitable officers for\\nsuperintending them. An increase of both the corps of engineers,\\nmilitary and topographical, was recommended by my predecessor at the\\nlast session of Congress. The reasons upon which that recommendation\\nwas founded subsist in all their force and have acquired additional\\nurgency since that time. The Military Academy at West Point will\\nfurnish from the cadets there officers well qualified for carrying this\\nmeasure into effect.\\n\\nThe Board of Engineers for Internal Improvement, appointed for carrying\\ninto execution the act of Congress of April 30th, 1824, \"to procure the\\nnecessary surveys, plans, and estimates on the subject of roads and\\ncanals\", have been actively engaged in that service from the close of\\nthe last session of Congress. They have completed the surveys necessary\\nfor ascertaining the practicability of a canal from the Chesapeake Bay\\nto the Ohio River, and are preparing a full report on that subject,\\nwhich, when completed, will be laid before you. The same observation is\\nto be made with regard to the two other objects of national importance\\nupon which the Board have been occupied, namely, the accomplishment of\\na national road from this city to New Orleans, and the practicability\\nof uniting the waters of Lake Memphramagog with Connecticut River and\\nthe improvement of the navigation of that river. The surveys have been\\nmade and are nearly completed. The report may be expected at an early\\nperiod during the present session of Congress.\\n\\nThe acts of Congress of the last session relative to the surveying,\\nmarking, or laying out roads in the Territories of Florida, Arkansas,\\nand Michigan, from Missouri to Mexico, and for the continuation of the\\nCumberland road, are, some of them, fully executed, and others in the\\nprocess of execution. Those for completing or commencing fortifications\\nhave been delayed only so far as the Corps of Engineers has been\\ninadequate to furnish officers for the necessary superintendence of the\\nworks. Under the act confirming the statutes of Virginia and Maryland\\nincorporating the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, three\\ncommissioners on the part of the United States have been appointed for\\nopening books and receiving subscriptions, in concert with a like\\nnumber of commissioners appointed on the part of each of those States.\\nA meeting of the commissioners has been postponed, to await the\\ndefinitive report of the board of engineers.\\n\\nThe light-houses and monuments for the safety of our commerce and\\nmariners, the works for the security of Plymouth Beach and for the\\npreservation of the islands in Boston Harbor, have received the\\nattention required by the laws relating to those objects respectively.\\nThe continuation of the Cumberland road, the most important of them\\nall, after surmounting no inconsiderable difficulty in fixing upon the\\ndirection of the road, has commenced under the most promising of\\nauspices, with the improvements of recent invention in the mode of\\nconstruction, and with advantage of a great reduction in the\\ncomparative cost of the work.\\n\\nThe operation of the laws relating to the Revolutionary pensioners may\\ndeserve the renewed consideration of Congress. The act of March 18th,\\n1818, while it made provision for many meritorious and indigent\\ncitizens who had served in the War of Independence, opened a door to\\nnumerous abuses and impositions. To remedy this the act of May 1st, 1820,\\nexacted proofs of absolute indigence, which many really in want were\\nunable and all susceptible of that delicacy which is allied to many\\nvirtues must be deeply reluctant to give. The result has been that some\\namong the least deserving have been retained, and some in whom the\\nrequisites both of worth and want were combined have been stricken from\\nthe list. As the numbers of these venerable relics of an age gone by\\ndiminish; as the decays of body, mind, and estate of those that survive\\nmust in the common course of nature increase, should not a more liberal\\nportion of indulgence be dealt out to them? May not the want in most\\ninstances be inferred from the demand when the service can be proved,\\nand may not the last days of human infirmity be spared the\\nmortification of purchasing a pittance of relief only by the exposure\\nof its own necessities? I submit to Congress the expediency of\\nproviding for individual cases of this description by special\\nenactment, or of revising the act of May 1st, 1820, with a view to\\nmitigate the rigor of its exclusions in favor of persons to whom\\ncharity now bestowed can scarcely discharge the debt of justice.\\n\\nThe portion of the naval force of the Union in actual service has been\\nchiefly employed on three stations--the Mediterranean, the coasts of\\nSouth America bordering on the Pacific Ocean, and the West Indies. An\\noccasional cruiser has been sent to range along the African shores most\\npolluted by the traffic of slaves; one armed vessel has been stationed\\non the coast of our eastern boundary, to cruise along the fishing\\ngrounds in Hudsons Bay and on the coast of Labrador, and the first\\nservice of a new frigate has been performed in restoring to his native\\nsoil and domestic enjoyments the veteran hero whose youthful blood and\\ntreasure had freely flowed in the cause of our country\\'s independence,\\nand whose whole life has been a series of services and sacrifices to\\nthe improvement of his fellow men.\\n\\nThe visit of General Lafayette, alike honorable to himself and to our\\ncountry, closed, as it had commenced, with the most affecting\\ntestimonials of devoted attachment on his part, and of unbounded\\ngratitude of this people to him in return. It will form here-after a\\npleasing incident in the annals of our Union, giving to real history\\nthe intense interest of romance and signally marking the unpurchasable\\ntribute of a great nation\\'s social affections to the disinterested\\nchampion of the liberties of human-kind.\\n\\nThe constant maintenance of a small squadron in the Mediterranean is a\\nnecessary substitute for the humiliating alternative of paying tribute\\nfor the security of our commerce in that sea, and for a precarious\\npeace, at the mercy of every caprice of four Barbary States, by whom it\\nwas liable to be violated. An additional motive for keeping a\\nrespectable force stationed there at this time is found in the maritime\\nwar raging between the Greeks and the Turks, and in which the neutral\\nnavigation of this Union is always in danger of outrage and\\ndepredation. A few instances have occurred of such depredations upon\\nour merchant vessels by privateers or pirates wearing the Grecian flag,\\nbut without real authority from the Greek or any other Government. The\\nheroic struggles of the Greeks themselves, in which our warmest\\nsympathies as free men and Christians have been engaged, have continued\\nto be maintained with vicissitudes of success adverse and favorable.\\n\\nSimilar motives have rendered expedient the keeping of a like force on\\nthe coasts of Peru and Chile on the Pacific. The irregular and\\nconvulsive character of the war upon the shores has been extended to\\nthe conflicts upon the ocean. An active warfare has been kept up for\\nyears with alternate success, though generally to the advantage of the\\nAmerican patriots. But their naval forces have not always been under\\nthe control of their own Governments. Blockades, unjustifiable upon any\\nacknowledged principles of international law, have been proclaimed by\\nofficers in command, and though disavowed by the supreme authorities,\\nthe protection of our own commerce against them has been made cause of\\ncomplaint and erroneous imputations against some of the most gallant\\nofficers of our Navy. Complaints equally groundless have been made by\\nthe commanders of the Spanish royal forces in those seas; but the most\\neffective protection to our commerce has been the flag and the firmness\\nof our own commanding officers.\\n\\nThe cessation of the war by the complete triumph of the patriot cause\\nhas removed, it is hoped, all cause of dissension with one party and\\nall vestige of force of the other. But an unsettled coast of many\\ndegrees of latitude forming a part of our own territory and a\\nflourishing commerce and fishery extending to the islands of the\\nPacific and to China still require that the protecting power of the\\nUnion should be displayed under its flag as well upon the ocean as upon\\nthe land.\\n\\nThe objects of the West India Squadron have been to carry into\\nexecution the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade; for\\nthe protection of our commerce against vessels of piratical character,\\nthough bearing commissions from either of the belligerent parties; for\\nits protection against open and unequivocal pirates. These objects\\nduring the present year have been accomplished more effectually than at\\nany former period. The African slave trade has long been excluded from\\nthe use of our flag, and if some few citizens of our country have\\ncontinued to set the laws of the Union as well as those of nature and\\nhumanity at defiance by persevering in that abominable traffic, it has\\nbeen only by sheltering themselves under the banners of other nations\\nless earnest for the total extinction of the trade of ours.\\n\\nThe active, persevering, and unremitted energy of Captain Warrington\\nand of the officers and men under his command on that trying and\\nperilous service have been crowned with signal success, and are\\nentitled to the approbation of their country. But experience has shown\\nthat not even a temporary suspension or relaxation from assiduity can\\nbe indulged on that station without reproducing piracy and murder in\\nall their horrors; nor is it probably that for years to come our\\nimmensely valuable commerce in those seas can navigate in security\\nwithout the steady continuance of an armed force devoted to its\\nprotection.\\n\\nIt were, indeed, a vain and dangerous illusion to believe that in the\\npresent or probable condition of human society a commerce so extensive\\nand so rich as ours could exist and be pursued in safety without the\\ncontinual support of a military marine--the only arm by which the power\\nof this Confederacy can be estimated or felt by foreign nations, and\\nthe only standing military force which can never be dangerous to our\\nown liberties at home. A permanent naval peace establishment,\\ntherefore, adapted to our present condition, and adaptable to that\\ngigantic growth with which the nation is advancing in its career, is\\namong the subjects which have already occupied the foresight of the\\nlast Congress, and which will deserve your serious deliberations. Our\\nNavy, commenced at an early period of our present political\\norganization upon a scale commensurate with the incipient energies, the\\nscanty resources, and the comparative indigence of our infancy, was\\neven then found adequate to cope with all the powers of Barbary, save\\nthe first, and with one of the principle maritime powers of Europe.\\n\\nAt a period of further advancement, but with little accession of\\nstrength, it not only sustained with honor the most unequal of\\nconflicts, but covered itself and our country with unfading glory. But\\nit is only since the close of the late war that by the numbers and\\nforce of the ships of which it was composed it could deserve the name\\nof a navy. Yet it retains nearly the same organization as when it\\nconsisted only of five frigates. The rules and regulations by which it\\nis governed earnestly call for revision, and the want of a naval school\\nof instruction, corresponding with the Military Academy at West Point,\\nfor the formation of scientific and accomplished officers, is felt with\\ndaily increasing aggravation.\\n\\nThe act of Congress of May 26th, 1824, authorizing an examination and\\nsurvey of the harbor of Charleston, in South Carolina, of St. Marys, in\\nGeorgia, and of the coast of Florida, and for other purposes, has been\\nexecuted so far as the appropriation would admit. Those of the 3d of\\nMarch last, authorizing the establishment of a navy yard and depot on\\nthe coast of Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico, and authorizing the\\nbuilding of ten sloops of war, and for other purposes, are in the\\ncourse of execution, for the particulars of which and other objects\\nconnected with this Department I refer to the report of the Secretary\\nof the Navy, herewith communicated.\\n\\nA report from the Post Master General is also submitted, exhibiting the\\npresent flourishing condition of that Department. For the first time\\nfor many years the receipts for the year ending on the first of July\\nlast exceeded the expenditures during the same period to the amount of\\nmore than $45,000. Other facts equally creditable to the administration\\nof this Department are that in two years from July 1st, 1823, an\\nimprovement of more than $185,000 in its pecuniary affairs has been\\nrealized; that in the same interval the increase of the transportation\\nof the mail has exceeded 1,500,000 miles annually, and that 1,040 new\\npost offices have been established. It hence appears that under\\njudicious management the income from this establishment may be relied\\non as fully adequate to defray its expenses, and that by the\\ndiscontinuance of post roads altogether unproductive, others of more\\nuseful character may be opened, \\'til the circulation of the mail shall\\nkeep pace with the spread of our population, and the comforts of\\nfriendly correspondence, the exchanges of internal traffic, and the\\nlights of the periodical press shall be distributed to the remotest\\ncorners of the Union, at a charge scarcely perceptible to any\\nindividual, and without the cost of a dollar to the public Treasury.\\n\\nUpon this first occasion of addressing the Legislature of the Union,\\nwith which I have been honored, in presenting to their view the\\nexecution so far as it has been effected of the measures sanctioned by\\nthem for promoting the internal improvement of our country, I can not\\nclose the communication without recommending to their calm and\\npersevering consideration the general principle in a more enlarged\\nextent. The great object of the institution of civil government is the\\nimprovement of the condition of those who are parties to the social\\ncompact, and no government, in what ever form constituted, can\\naccomplish the lawful ends of its institution but in proportion as it\\nimproves the condition of those over whom it is established. Roads and\\ncanals, by multiplying and facilitating the communications and\\nintercourse between distant regions and multitudes of men, are among\\nthe most important means of improvement. But moral, political,\\nintellectual improvement are duties assigned by the Author of Our\\nExistence to social no less than to individual man.\\n\\nFor the fulfillment of those duties governments are invested with\\npower, and to the attainment of the end--the progressive improvement of\\nthe condition of the governed--the exercise of delegated powers is a\\nduty as sacred and indispensable as the usurpation of powers not\\ngranted is criminal and odious.\\n\\nAmong the first, perhaps the very first, instrument for the improvement\\nof the condition of men is knowledge, and to the acquisition of much of\\nthe knowledge adapted to the wants, the comforts, and enjoyments of\\nhuman life public institutions and seminaries of learning are\\nessential. So convinced of this was the first of my predecessors in\\nthis office, now first in the memory, as, living, he was first in the\\nhearts, of our country-men, that once and again in his addresses to the\\nCongresses with whom he cooperated in the public service he earnestly\\nrecommended the establishment of seminaries of learning, to prepare for\\nall the emergencies of peace and war--a national university and a\\nmilitary academy. With respect to the latter, had he lived to the\\npresent day, in turning his eyes to the institution at West Point he\\nwould have enjoyed the gratification of his most earnest wishes; but in\\nsurveying the city which has been honored with his name he would have\\nseen the spot of earth which he had destined and bequeathed to the use\\nand benefit of his country as the site for a university still bare and\\nbarren.\\n\\nIn assuming her station among the civilized nations of the earth it\\nwould seem that our country had contracted the engagement to contribute\\nher share of mind, of labor, and of expense to the improvement of those\\nparts of knowledge which lie beyond the reach of individual\\nacquisition, and particularly to geographical and astronomical science.\\nLooking back to the history only of the half century since the\\ndeclaration of our independence, and observing the generous emulation\\nwith which the Governments of France, Great Britain, and Russia have\\ndevoted the genius, the intelligence, the treasures of their respective\\nnations to the common improvement of the species in these branches of\\nscience, is it not incumbent upon us to inquire whether we are not\\nbound by obligations of a high and honorable character to contribute\\nour portion of energy and exertion to the common stock? The voyages of\\ndiscovery prosecuted in the course of that time at the expense of those\\nnations have not only redounded to their glory, but to the improvement\\nof human knowledge.\\n\\nWe have been partakers of that improvement and owe for it a sacred\\ndebt, not only of gratitude, but of equal or proportional exertion in\\nthe same common cause. Of the cost of these undertakings, if the mere\\nexpenditures of outfit, equipment, and completion of the expeditions\\nwere to be considered the only charges, it would be unworthy of a great\\nand generous nation to take a second thought. One hundred expeditions\\nof circumnavigation like those of Cook and La Prouse would not burden\\nthe exchequer of the nation fitting them out so much as the ways and\\nmeans of defraying a single campaign in war. But if we take into\\naccount the lives of those benefactors of man-kind of which their\\nservices in the cause of their species were the purchase, how shall the\\ncost of those heroic enterprises be estimated, and what compensation\\ncan be made to them or to their countries for them? Is it not by\\nbearing them in affectionate remembrance? Is it not still more by\\nimitating their example--by enabling country-men of our own to pursue\\nthe same career and to hazard their lives in the same cause?\\n\\nIn inviting the attention of Congress to the subject of internal\\nimprovements upon a view thus enlarged it is not my desire to recommend\\nthe equipment of an expedition for circumnavigating the globe for\\npurposes of scientific research and inquiry. We have objects of useful\\ninvestigation nearer home, and to which our cares may be more\\nbeneficially applied. The interior of our own territories has yet been\\nvery imperfectly explored. Our coasts along many degrees of latitude\\nupon the shores of the Pacific Ocean, though much frequented by our\\nspirited commercial navigators, have been barely visited by our public\\nships. The River of the West, first fully discovered and navigated by a\\ncountry-man of our own, still bears the name of the ship in which he\\nascended its waters, and claims the protection of our armed national\\nflag at its mouth. With the establishment of a military post there or\\nat some other point of that coast, recommended by my predecessor and\\nalready matured in the deliberations of the last Congress, I would\\nsuggest the expediency of connecting the equipment of a public ship for\\nthe exploration of the whole north-west coast of this continent.\\n\\nThe establishment of an uniform standard of weights and measures was\\none of the specific objects contemplated in the formation of our\\nConstitution, and to fix that standard was on of the powers delegated\\nby express terms in that instrument to Congress. The Governments of\\nGreat Britain and France have scarcely ceased to be occupied with\\ninquiries and speculations on the same subject since the existence of\\nour Constitution, and with them it has expanded into profound,\\nlaborious, and expensive researches into the figure of the earth and\\nthe comparative length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in various\\nlatitudes from the equator to the pole. These researches have resulted\\nin the composition and publication of several works highly interesting\\nto the cause of science. The experiments are yet in the process of\\nperformance. Some of them have recently been made on our own shores,\\nwithin the walls of one of our own colleges, and partly by one of our\\nown fellow citizens. It would be honorable to our country if the sequel\\nof the same experiments should be countenanced by the patronage of our\\nGovernment, as they have hitherto been by those of France and Britain.\\n\\nConnected with the establishment of an university, or separate from it,\\nmight be undertaken the erection of an astronomical observatory, with\\nprovision for the support of an astronomer, to be in constant\\nattendance of observation upon the phenomena of the heavens, and for\\nthe periodical publication of his observances. It is with no feeling of\\npride as an American that the remark may be made that on the\\ncomparatively small territorial surface of Europe there are existing\\nupward of 130 of these light-houses of the skies, while throughout the\\nwhole American hemisphere there is not one. If we reflect a moment upon\\nthe discoveries which in the last four centuries have been made in the\\nphysical constitution of the universe by the means of these buildings\\nand of observers stationed in them, shall we doubt of their usefulness\\nto every nation? And while scarcely a year passes over our heads\\nwithout bringing some new astronomical discovery to light, which we\\nmust fain receive at second hand from Europe, are we not cutting\\nourselves off from the means of returning light for light while we have\\nneither observatory nor observer upon our half of the globe and the\\nearth revolves in perpetual darkness to our unsearching eyes?\\n\\nWhen, on October 25th, 1791, the first President of the United States\\nannounced to Congress the result of the first enumeration of the\\ninhabitants of this Union, he informed them that the returns gave the\\npleasing assurance that the population of the United States bordered on\\n4,000,000 persons. At the distance of 30 years from that time the last\\nenumeration, five years since completed, presented a population\\nbordering on 10,000,000. Perhaps of all the evidence of a prosperous\\nand happy condition of human society the rapidity of the increase of\\npopulation is the most unequivocal. But the demonstration of our\\nprosperity rests not alone upon this indication.\\n\\nOur commerce, our wealth, and the extent of our territories have\\nincreased in corresponding proportions, and the number of independent\\ncommunities associated in our Federal Union has since that time nearly\\ndoubled. The legislative representation of the States and people in the\\ntwo Houses of Congress has grown with the growth of their constituent\\nbodies. The House, which then consisted of 65 members, now numbers\\nupward of 200. The Senate, which consisted of 26 members, has now 48.\\nBut the executive and, still more, the judiciary departments are yet in\\na great measure confined to their primitive organization, and are now\\nnot adequate to the urgent wants of a still growing community.\\n\\nThe naval armaments, which at an early period forced themselves upon\\nthe necessities of the Union, soon led to the establishment of a\\nDepartment of the Navy. But the Departments of Foreign Affairs and of\\nthe Interior, which early after the formation of the Government had\\nbeen united in one, continue so united to this time, to the\\nunquestionable detriment of the public service. The multiplication of\\nour relations with the nations and Governments of the Old World has\\nkept pace with that of our population and commerce, while within the\\nlast ten years a new family of nations in our own hemisphere has arisen\\namong the inhabitants of the earth, with whom our intercourse,\\ncommercial and political, would of itself furnish occupation to an\\nactive and industrious department.\\n\\nThe constitution of the judiciary, experimental and imperfect as it was\\neven in the infancy of our existing Government, is yet more inadequate\\nto the administration of national justice at our present maturity. Nine\\nyears have elapsed since a predecessor in this office, now not the\\nlast, the citizen who, perhaps, of all others throughout the Union\\ncontributed most to the formation and establishment of our\\nConstitution, in his valedictory address to Congress, immediately\\npreceding his retirement from public life, urgently recommended the\\nrevision of the judiciary and the establishment of an additional\\nexecutive department. The exigencies of the public service and its\\nunavoidable deficiencies, as now in exercise, have added yearly\\ncumulative weight to the considerations presented by him as persuasive\\nto the measure, and in recommending it to your deliberations I am happy\\nto have the influence of this high authority in aid of the undoubting\\nconvictions of my own experience.\\n\\nThe laws relating to the administration of the Patent Office are\\ndeserving of much consideration and perhaps susceptible of some\\nimprovement. The grant of power to regulate the action of Congress upon\\nthis subject has specified both the end to be obtained and the means by\\nwhich it is to be effected, \"to promote the progress of science and\\nuseful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the\\nexclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries\". If an\\nhonest pride might be indulged in the reflection that on the records of\\nthat office are already found inventions the usefulness of which has\\nscarcely been transcended in the annals of human ingenuity, would not\\nits exultation be allayed by the inquiry whether the laws have\\neffectively insured to the inventors the reward destined to them by the\\nConstitution--even a limited term of exclusive right to their\\ndiscoveries?\\n\\nOn December 24th, 1799, it was resolved by Congress that a marble\\nmonument should be erected by the United States in the Capitol at the\\ncity of Washington; that the family of General Washington should be\\nrequested to permit his body to be deposited under it, and that the\\nmonument be so designed as to commemorate the great events of his\\nmilitary and political life. In reminding Congress of this resolution\\nand that the monument contemplated by it remains yet without execution,\\nI shall indulge only the remarks that the works at the Capitol are\\napproaching to completion; that the consent of the family, desired by\\nthe resolution, was requested and obtained; that a monument has been\\nrecently erected in this city over the remains of another distinguished\\npatriot of the Revolution, and that a spot has been reserved within the\\nwalls where you are deliberating for the benefit of this and future\\nages, in which the mortal remains may be deposited of him whose spirit\\nhovers over you and listens with delight to every act of the\\nrepresentatives of his nation which can tend to exalt and adorn his and\\ntheir country.\\n\\nThe Constitution under which you are assembled is a charter of limited\\npowers. After full and solemn deliberation upon all or any of the\\nobjects which, urged by an irresistible sense of my own duty, I have\\nrecommended to your attention should you come to the conclusion that,\\nhowever desirable in themselves, the enactment of laws for effecting\\nthem would transcend the powers committed to you by that venerable\\ninstrument which we are all bound to support, let no consideration\\ninduce you to assume the exercise of powers not granted to you by the\\npeople.\\n\\nBut if the power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases what so\\never over the District of Columbia; if the power to lay and collect\\ntaxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and provide for\\nthe common defense and general welfare of the United States; if the\\npower to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several\\nStates and with the Indian tribes, to fix the standard of weights and\\nmeasures, to establish post offices and post roads, to declare war, to\\nraise and support armies, to provide and maintain a navy, to dispose of\\nand make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or\\nother property belonging to the United States, and to make all laws\\nwhich shall be necessary and proper for carrying these powers into\\nexecution--if these powers and others enumerated in the Constitution\\nmay be effectually brought into action by laws promoting the\\nimprovement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, the cultivation\\nand encouragement of the mechanic and of the elegant arts, the\\nadvancement of literature, and the progress of the sciences, ornamental\\nand profound, to refrain from exercising them for the benefit of the\\npeople themselves would be to hide in the earth the talent committed to\\nour charge--would be treachery to the most sacred of trusts.\\n\\nThe spirit of improvement is abroad upon the earth. It stimulates the\\nhearts and sharpens the faculties not of our fellow citizens alone, but\\nof the nations of Europe and of their rulers. While dwelling with\\npleasing satisfaction upon the superior excellence of our political\\ninstitutions, let us not be unmindful that liberty is power; that the\\nnation blessed with the largest portion of liberty must in proportion\\nto its numbers be the most powerful nation upon earth, and that the\\ntenure of power by man is, in the moral purposes of his Creator, upon\\ncondition that it shall be exercised to ends of beneficence, to improve\\nthe condition of himself and his fellow men.\\n\\nWhile foreign nations less blessed with that freedom which is power\\nthan ourselves are advancing with gigantic strides in the career of\\npublic improvement, were we to slumber in indolence or fold up our arms\\nand proclaim to the world that we are palsied by the will of our\\nconstituents, would it not be to cast away the bounties of Providence\\nand doom ourselves to perpetual inferiority? In the course of the year\\nnow drawing to its close we have beheld, under the auspices and at the\\nexpense of one State of this Union, a new university unfolding its\\nportals to the sons of science and holding up the torch of human\\nimprovement to eyes that seek the light. We have seen under the\\npersevering and enlightened enterprise of another State the waters of\\nour Western lakes mingle with those of the ocean. If undertakings like\\nthese have been accomplished in the compass of a few years by the\\nauthority of single members of our Confederation, can we, the\\nrepresentative authorities of the whole Union, fall behind our fellow\\nservants in the exercise of the trust committed to us for the benefit\\nof our common sovereign by the accomplishment of works important to the\\nwhole and to which neither the authority nor the resources of any one\\nState can be adequate?\\n\\nFinally, fellow citizens, I shall await with cheering hope and faithful\\ncooperation the result of your deliberations, assured that, without\\nencroaching upon the powers reserved to the authorities of the\\nrespective States or to the people, you will, with a due sense of your\\nobligations to your country and of the high responsibilities weighing\\nupon yourselves, give efficacy to the means committed to you for the\\ncommon good. And may He who searches the hearts of the children of men\\nprosper your exertions to secure the blessings of peace and promote the\\nhighest welfare of your country.\\n\\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS',\n",
       " 'Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nImmediately after the adjournment of Congress at their last session in\\nPhiladelphia I gave directions, in compliance with the laws, for the\\nremoval of the public offices, records, and property. These directions have\\nbeen executed, and the public officers have since resided and conducted the\\nordinary business of the Government in this place.\\n\\nI congratulate the people of the United States on the assembling of\\nCongress at the permanent seat of their Government, and I congratulate you,\\ngentlemen, on the prospect of a residence not to be changed. Although there\\nis cause to apprehend that accommodations are not now so complete as might\\nbe wished, yet there is great reason to believe that this inconvenience\\nwill cease with the present session.\\n\\nIt would be unbecoming the representatives of this nation to assemble for\\nthe first time in this solemn temple without looking up to the Supreme\\nRuler of the Universe and imploring His blessing.\\n\\nMay this territory be the residence of virtue and happiness! In this city\\nmay that piety and virtue, that wisdom and magnanimity, that constancy and\\nself-government, which adorned the great character whose name it bears be\\nforever held in veneration! Here and throughout our country may simple\\nmanners, pure morals, and true religion flourish forever!\\n\\nIt is with you, gentlemen, to consider whether the local powers over the\\nDistrict of Columbia vested by the Constitution in the Congress of the\\nUnited States shall be immediately exercised. If in your opinion this\\nimportant trust ought now to be executed, you can not fail while performing\\nit to take into view the future probable situation of the territory for the\\nhappiness of which you are about to provide. You will consider it as the\\ncapital of a great nation advancing with unexampled rapidity in arts, in\\ncommerce, in wealth, and in population, and possessing within itself those\\nenergies and resources which, if not thrown away or lamentably misdirected,\\nwill secure to it a long course of prosperity and self-government.\\n\\nIn compliance with a law of the last session of Congress, the officers and\\nsoldiers of the temporary army have been discharged. It affords real\\npleasure to recollect the honorable testimony they gave of the patriotic\\nmotives which brought them into the service of their country, by the\\nreadiness and regularity with which they returned to the station of private\\ncitizens.\\n\\nIt is in every point of view of such primary importance to carry the laws\\ninto prompt and faithful execution, and to render that part of the\\nadministration of justice which the Constitution and laws devolve on the\\nFederal courts as convenient to the people as may consist with their\\npresent circumstances, that I can not omit once more to recommend to your\\nserious consideration the judiciary system of the United States. No subject\\nis more interesting than this to the public happiness, and to none can\\nthose improvements which may have been suggested by experience be more\\nbeneficially applied.\\n\\nA treaty of amity and commerce with the King of Prussia has been concluded\\nand ratified. The ratifications have been exchanged, and I have directed\\nthe treaty to be promulgated by proclamation.\\n\\nThe difficulties which suspended the execution of the 6th article of our\\ntreaty of amity, commerce, and navigation with Great Britain have not yet\\nbeen removed. The negotiation on this subject is still depending. As it\\nmust be for the interest and honor of both nations to adjust this\\ndifference with good faith, I indulge confidently the expectation that the\\nsincere endeavors of the Government of the United States to bring it to an\\namicable termination will not be disappointed.\\n\\nThe envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary from the United\\nStates to France were received by the First Consul with the respect due to\\ntheir character, and 3 persons with equal powers were appointed to treat\\nwith them. Although at the date of the last official intelligence the\\nnegotiation had not terminated, yet it is to be hoped that our efforts to\\neffect an accommodation will at length meet with a success proportioned to\\nthe sincerity with which they have been so often repeated.\\n\\nWhile our best endeavors for the preservation of harmony with all nations\\nwill continue to be used, the experience of the world and our own\\nexperience admonish us of the insecurity of trusting too confidently to\\ntheir success. We can not, without committing a dangerous imprudence,\\nabandon those measures of self protection which are adapted to our\\nsituation and to which, notwithstanding our pacific policy, the violence\\nand injustice of others may again compel us to resort. While our vast\\nextent of sea coast, the commercial and agriculture habits of our people,\\nthe great capital they will continue to trust on the ocean, suggest the\\nsystem of defense which will be most beneficial to ourselves, our distance\\nfrom Europe and our resources for maritime strength will enable us to\\nemploy it with effect. Seasonable and systematic arrangements, so far as\\nour resources will justify, for a navy adapted to defensive war, and which\\nmay in case of necessity be quickly brought into use, seem to be as much\\nrecommended by a wise and true economy as by a just regard for our future\\ntranquillity, for the safety of our shores, and for the protection of our\\nproperty committed to the ocean.\\n\\nThe present Navy of the United States, called suddenly into existence by a\\ngreat national exigency, has raised us in our own esteem, and by the\\nprotection afforded to our commerce has effected to the extent of our\\nexpectations the objects for which it was created.\\n\\nIn connection with a navy ought to be contemplated the fortification of\\nsome of our principal sea ports and harbors. A variety of considerations,\\nwhich will readily suggest themselves, urge an attention to this measure of\\nprecaution. To give security to our principal ports considerable sums have\\nalready been expended, but the works remain incomplete. It is for Congress\\nto determine whether additional appropriations shall be made in order to\\nrender competent to the intended purposes the fortifications which have\\nbeen commenced.\\n\\nThe manufacture of arms within the United States still invites the\\nattention of the National Legislature. At a considerable expense to the\\npublic this manufacture has been brought to such a state of maturity as,\\nwith continued encouragement, will supersede the necessity of future\\nimportations from foreign countries.\\n\\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nI shall direct the estimates of the appropriations necessary for the\\nensuing year, together with an account of the public revenue and\\nexpenditure to a late period, to be laid before you. I observe with much\\nsatisfaction that the product of the revenue during the present year has\\nbeen more considerable than during any former equal period. This result\\naffords conclusive evidence of the great resources of this country and of\\nthe wisdom and efficiency of the measures which have been adopted by\\nCongress for the protection of commerce and preservation of public credit.\\n\\nGentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nAs one of the grand community of nations, our attention is irresistibly\\ndrawn to the important scenes which surround us. If they have exhibited an\\nuncommon portion of calamity, it is the province of humanity to deplore and\\nof wisdom to avoid the causes which may have produced it. If, turning our\\neyes homeward, we find reason to rejoice at the prospect which presents\\nitself; if we perceive the interior of our country prosperous, free, and\\nhappy; if all enjoy in safety, under the protection of laws emanating only\\nfrom the general will, the fruits of their own labor, we ought to fortify\\nand cling to those institutions which have been the source of such real\\nfelicity and resist with unabating perseverance the progress of those\\ndangerous innovations which may diminish their influence.\\n\\nTo your patriotism, gentlemen, has been confided the honorable duty of\\nguarding the public interests; and while the past is to your country a sure\\npledge that it will be faithfully discharged, permit me to assure you that\\nyour labors to promote the general happiness will receive from me the most\\nzealous cooperation.',\n",
       " \"Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\\n\\nIf the enjoyment in profusion of the bounties of Providence forms a\\nsuitable subject of mutual gratulation and grateful acknowledgment, we\\nare admonished at this return of the season when the representatives of\\nthe nation are assembled to deliberate upon their concerns to offer up\\nthe tribute of fervent and grateful hearts for the never failing\\nmercies of Him who ruleth over all. He has again favored us with\\nhealthful seasons and abundant harvests; He has sustained us in peace\\nwith foreign countries and in tranquillity within our borders; He has\\npreserved us in the quiet and undisturbed possession of civil and\\nreligious liberty; He has crowned the year with His goodness, imposing\\non us no other condition than of improving for our own happiness the\\nblessings bestowed by His hands, and, in the fruition of all His\\nfavors, of devoting his faculties with which we have been endowed by\\nHim to His glory and to our own temporal and eternal welfare.\\n\\nIn the relations of our Federal Union with our brethren of the human\\nrace the changes which have occurred since the close of your last\\nsession have generally tended to the preservation of peace and to the\\ncultivation of harmony. Before your last separation a war had unhappily\\nbeen kindled between the Empire of Russia, one of those with which our\\nintercourse has been no other than a constant exchange of good offices,\\nand that of the Ottoman Porte, a nation from which geographical\\ndistance, religious opinions and maxims of government on their part\\nlittle suited to the formation of those bonds of mutual benevolence\\nwhich result from the benefits of commerce had department us in a\\nstate, perhaps too much prolonged, of coldness and alienation.\\n\\nThe extensive, fertile, and populous dominions of the Sultan belong\\nrather to the Asiatic than the European division of the human family.\\nThey enter but partially into the system of Europe, nor have their wars\\nwith Russia and Austria, the European States upon which they border,\\nfor more than a century past disturbed the pacific relations of those\\nStates with the other great powers of Europe. Neither France nor\\nPrussia nor Great Britain has ever taken part in them, nor is it to be\\nexpected that they will at this time. The declaration of war by Russia\\nhas received the approbation or acquiescence of her allies, and we may\\nindulge the hope that its progress and termination will be signalized\\nby the moderation and forbearance no less than by the energy of the\\nEmperor Nicholas, and that it will afford the opportunity for such\\ncollateral agency in behalf of the suffering Greeks as will secure to\\nthem ultimately the triumph of humanity and of freedom.\\n\\nThe state of our particular relations with France has scarcely varied\\nin the course of the present year. The commercial intercourse between\\nthe two countries has continued to increase for the mutual benefit of\\nboth. The claims of indemnity to numbers of our fellow citizens for\\ndepredations upon their property, heretofore committed during the\\nrevolutionary governments, remain unadjusted, and still form the\\nsubject of earnest representation and remonstrance. Recent advices from\\nthe minister of the United States at Paris encourage the expectation\\nthat the appeal to the justice of the French Government will ere long\\nreceive a favorable consideration.\\n\\nThe last friendly expedient has been resorted to for the decision of\\nthe controversy with Great Britain relating to the north-eastern\\nboundary of the United States. By an agreement with the British\\nGovernment, carrying into effect the provisions of the 5th article of\\nthe treaty of Ghent, and the convention of September 29th, 1827, His\\nMajesty the King of the Netherlands has by common consent been selected\\nas the umpire between the parties. The proposal to him to accept the\\ndesignation for the performance of this friendly office will be made at\\nan early day, and the United States, relying upon the justice of their\\ncause, will cheerfully commit the arbitrament of it to a prince equally\\ndistinguished for the independence of his spirit, his indefatigable\\nassiduity to the duties of his station, and his inflexible personal\\nprobity.\\n\\nOur commercial relations with Great Britain will deserve the serious\\nconsideration of Congress and the exercise of a conciliatory and\\nforbearing spirit in the policy of both Governments. The state of them\\nhas been materially changed by the act of Congress, passed at their\\nlast session, in alteration of several acts imposing duties on imports,\\nand by acts of more recent date of the British Parliament. The effect\\nof the interdiction of direct trade, commenced by Great Britain and\\nreciprocated by the United States, has been, as was to be foreseen,\\nonly to substitute different channels for an exchange of commodities\\nindispensable to the colonies and profitable to a numerous class of our\\nfellow citizens. The exports, the revenue, the navigation of the United\\nStates have suffered no diminution by our exclusion from direct access\\nto the British colonies. The colonies pay more dearly for the\\nnecessaries of life which their Government burdens with the charges of\\ndouble voyages, freight, insurance, and commission, and the profits of\\nour exports are somewhat impaired and more injuriously transferred from\\none portion of our citizens to another.\\n\\nThe resumption of this old and otherwise exploded system of colonial\\nexclusion has not secured to the shipping interest of Great Britain the\\nrelief which, at the expense of the distant colonies and of the United\\nStates, it was expected to afford. Other measures have been resorted to\\nmore pointedly bearing upon the navigation of the United States, and\\nmore pointedly bearing upon the navigation of the United States, and\\nwhich, unless modified by the construction given to the recent acts of\\nParliament, will be manifestly incompatible with the positive\\nstipulations of the commercial convention existing between the two\\ncountries. That convention, however, may be terminated with 12 months'\\nnotice, at the option of either party.\\n\\nA treaty of amity, navigation, and commerce between the United States\\nand His Majesty the Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary and Bohemia,\\nhas been prepared for signature by the Secretary of State and by the\\nBaron de Lederer, intrusted with full powers of the Austrian\\nGovernment. Independently of the new and friendly relations which may\\nbe thus commenced with one of the most eminent and powerful nations of\\nthe earth, the occasion has been taken in it, as in other recent\\ntreaties concluded by the United States, to extend those principles of\\nliberal intercourse and of fair reciprocity which intertwine with the\\nexchanges of commerce the principles of justice and the feelings of\\nmutual benevolence.\\n\\nThis system, first proclaimed to the world in the first commercial\\ntreaty ever concluded by the United States--that of February 6th, 1778,\\nwith France--has been invariably the cherished policy of our Union. It\\nis by treaties of commerce alone that it can be made ultimately to\\nprevail as the established system of all civilized nations. With this\\nprinciple our fathers extended the hand of friendship to every nation\\nof the globe, and to this policy our country has ever since adhered.\\nWhat ever of regulation in our laws has ever been adopted unfavorable\\nto the interest of any foreign nation has been essentially defensive\\nand counteracting to similar regulations of theirs operating against\\nus.\\n\\nImmediately after the close of the War of Independence commissioners\\nwere appointed by the Congress of the Confederation authorized to\\nconclude treaties with every nation of Europe disposed to adopt them.\\nBefore the wars of the French Revolution such treaties had been\\nconsummated with the United Netherlands, Sweden, and Prussia. During\\nthose wars treaties with Great Britain and Spain had been effected, and\\nthose with Prussia and France renewed. In all these some concessions to\\nthe liberal principles of intercourse proposed by the United States had\\nbeen obtained; but as in all the negotiations they came occasionally in\\ncollision with previous internal regulations or exclusive and excluding\\ncompacts of monopoly with which the other parties had been trammeled,\\nthe advances made in them toward the freedom of trade were partial and\\nimperfect. Colonial establishments, chartered companies, and ship\\nbuilding influence pervaded and encumbered the legislation of all the\\ngreat commercial states; and the United States, in offering free trade\\nand equal privilege to all, were compelled to acquiesce in many\\nexceptions with each of the parties to their treaties, accommodated to\\ntheir existing laws and anterior agreements.\\n\\nThe colonial system by which this whole hemisphere was bound has fallen\\ninto ruins, totally abolished by revolutions converting colonies into\\nindependent nations throughout the two American continents, excepting a\\nportion of territory chiefly at the northern extremity of our own, and\\nconfined to the remnants of dominion retained by Great Britain over the\\ninsular archipelago, geographically the appendages of our part of the\\nglobe. With all the rest we have free trade, even with the insular\\ncolonies of all the European nations, except Great Britain. Her\\nGovernment also had manifested approaches to the adoption of a free and\\nliberal intercourse between her colonies and other nations, though by a\\nsudden and scarcely explained revulsion the spirit of exclusion has\\nbeen revived for operation upon the United States alone.\\n\\nThe conclusion of our last treaty of peace with Great Britain was\\nshortly afterwards followed by a commercial convention, placing the\\ndirect intercourse between the two countries upon a footing of more\\nequal reciprocity than had ever before been admitted. The same\\nprinciple has since been much further extended by treaties with France,\\nSweden, Denmark, the Hanseatic cities, Prussia, in Europe, and with the\\nRepublics of Colombia and of Central America, in this hemisphere. The\\nmutual abolition of discriminating duties and charges upon the\\nnavigation and commercial intercourse between the parties is the\\ngeneral maxim which characterizes them all. There is reason to expect\\nthat it will at no distant period be adopted by other nations, both of\\nEurope and America, and to hope that by its universal prevalence one of\\nthe fruitful sources of wars of commercial competition will be\\nextinguished.\\n\\nAmong the nations upon whose Governments many of our fellow citizens\\nhave had long-pending claims of indemnity for depredations upon their\\nproperty during a period when the rights of neutral commerce were\\ndisregarded was that of Denmark. They were soon after the events\\noccurred the subject of a special mission from the United States, at\\nthe close of which the assurance was given by His Danish Majesty that\\nat a period of more tranquillity and of less distress they would be\\nconsidered, examined, and decided upon in a spirit of determined\\npurpose for the dispensation of justice. I have much pleasure in\\ninforming Congress that the fulfillment of this honorable promise is\\nnow in progress; that a small portion of the claims has already been\\nsettled to the satisfaction of the claimants, and that we have reason\\nto hope that the remainder will shortly be placed in a train of\\nequitable adjustment. This result has always been confidently expected,\\nfrom the character of personal integrity and of benevolence which the\\nSovereign of the Danish dominions has through every vicissitude of\\nfortune maintained.\\n\\nThe general aspect of the affairs of our neighboring American nations\\nof the south has been rather of approaching than of settled\\ntranquillity. Internal disturbances have been more frequent among them\\nthan their common friends would have desired. Our intercourse with all\\nhas continued to be that of friendship and of mutual good will.\\nTreaties of commerce and of boundaries with the United Mexican States\\nhave been negotiated, but, from various successive obstacles, not yet\\nbrought to a final conclusion.\\n\\nThe civil war which unfortunately still prevails in the Republics of\\nCentral America has been unpropitious to the cultivation of our\\ncommercial relations with them; and the dissensions and revolutionary\\nchanges in the Republics of Colombia and of Peru have been seen with\\ncordial regret by us, who would gladly contribute to the happiness of\\nboth. It is with great satisfaction, however, that we have witnessed\\nthe recent conclusion of a peace between the Governments of Buenos\\nAyres and of Brazil, and it is equally gratifying to observe that\\nindemnity has been obtained for some of the injuries which our fellow\\ncitizens had sustained in the latter of those countries. The rest are\\nin a train of negotiation, which we hope may terminate to mutual\\nsatisfaction, and that it may be succeeded by a treaty of commerce and\\nnavigation, upon liberal principles, propitious to a great and growing\\ncommerce, already important to the interests of our country.\\n\\nThe condition and prospects of the revenue are more favorable than our\\nmost sanguine expectations had anticipated. The balance in the Treasury\\non January 1st, 1828, exclusive of the moneys received under the\\nconvention of November 13th, 1826, with Great Britain, was\\n$5,861,972.83. The receipts into the Treasury from January 1st, 1828 to\\nSeptember 30th, 1828, so far as they have been ascertained to form the\\nbasis of an estimate, amount to $18,633,580.27, which, with the\\nreceipts of the present quarter, estimated at $5,461,283.40, form an\\naggregate of receipts during the year of $24,094,863.67. The\\nexpenditures of the year may probably amount to $25,637,111.63, and\\nleave in the Treasury on January 1st, 1829 the sum of $5,125,638.14.\\n\\nThe receipts of the present year have amounted to near $2,000,000 more\\nthan was anticipated at the commencement of the last session of\\nCongress.\\n\\nThe amount of duties secured on importations from the first of January\\nto the 30th of September was about $22,997,000, and that of the\\nestimated accruing revenue is $5,000,000, forming an aggregate for the\\nyear of near $28,000,000. This is $1,000,000 more than the estimate\\nlast December for the accruing revenue of the present year, which, with\\nallowances for draw-backs and contingent deficiencies, was expected to\\nproduce an actual revenue of $22,300,000. Had these only been realized\\nthe expenditures of the year would have been also proportionally\\nreduced, for of these $24,000,000 received upward of $9,000,000 have\\nbeen applied to the extinction of public debt, bearing an interest of\\n6% a year, and of course reducing the burden of interest annually\\npayable in future by the amount of more than $500,000. The payments on\\naccount of interest during the current year exceed $3,000,000,\\npresenting an aggregate of more than $12,000,000 applied during the\\nyear to the discharge of the public debt, the whole of which remaining\\ndue on January 1st, 1829 will amount only to $58,362,135.78.\\n\\nThat the revenue of the ensuing year will not fall short of that\\nreceived in the one now expiring there are indications which can\\nscarcely prove deceptive. In our country an uniform experience of 40\\nyears has shown that what ever the tariff of duties upon articles\\nimported from abroad has been, the amount of importations has always\\nborne an average value nearly approaching to that of the exports,\\nthough occasionally differing in the balance, some times being more and\\nsome times less. It is, indeed, a general law of prosperous commerce\\nthat the real value of exports should by a small, and only a small,\\nbalance exceed that of imports, that balance being a permanent addition\\nto the wealth of the nation.\\n\\nThe extent of the prosperous commerce of the nation must be regulated\\nby the amount of its exports, and an important addition to the value of\\nthese will draw after it a corresponding increase of importations. It\\nhas happened in the vicissitudes of the seasons that the harvests of\\nall Europe have in the late summer and autumn fallen short of their\\nusual average. A relaxation of the interdict upon the importation of\\ngrain and flour from abroad has ensued, a propitious market has been\\nopened to the granaries of our country, and a new prospect of reward\\npresented to the labors of the husband-man, which for several years has\\nbeen denied. This accession to the profits of agriculture in the middle\\nand western portions of our Union is accidental and temporary. It may\\ncontinue only for a single year. It may be, as has been often\\nexperienced in the revolutions of time, but the first of several scanty\\nharvests in succession. We may consider it certain that for the\\napproaching year it has added an item of large amount to the value of\\nour exports and that it will produce a corresponding increase of\\nimportations. It may therefore confidently be foreseen that the revenue\\nof 1829 will equal and probably exceed that of 1828, and will afford\\nthe means of extinguishing $10,000,000 more of the principal of the\\npublic debt.\\n\\nThis new element of prosperity to that part of our agricultural\\nindustry which is occupied in producing the first article of human\\nsubsistence is of the most cheering character to the feelings of\\npatriotism. Proceeding from a cause which humanity will view with\\nconcern, the sufferings of scarcity in distant lands, it yields a\\nconsolatory reflection that this scarcity is in no respect attributable\\nto us; that it comes from the dispensation of Him who ordains all in\\nwisdom and goodness, and who permits evil itself only as an instrument\\nof good; that, far from contributing to this scarcity, our agency will\\nbe applied only to the alleviation of its severity, and that in pouring\\nforth from the abundance of our own garners the supplies which will\\npartially restore plenty to those who are in need we shall ourselves\\nreduce our stores and add to the price of our own bread, so as in some\\ndegree to participate in the wants which it will be the good fortune of\\nour country to relieve.\\n\\nThe great interests of an agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing\\nnation are so linked in union together that no permanent cause of\\nprosperity to one of them can operate without extending its influence\\nto the others. All these interests are alike under the protecting power\\nof the legislative authority, and the duties of the representative\\nbodies are to conciliate them in harmony together.\\n\\nSo far as the object of taxation is to raise a revenue for discharging\\nthe debts and defraying the expenses of the community, its operation\\nshould be adapted as much as possible to suit the burden with equal\\nhand upon all in proportion with their ability of bearing it without\\noppression. But the legislation of one nation is some times\\nintentionally made to bear heavily upon the interests of another. That\\nlegislation, adapted, as it is meant to be, to the special interests of\\nits own people, will often press most unequally upon the several\\ncomponent interests of its neighbors.\\n\\nThus the legislation of Great Britain, when, as has recently been\\navowed, adapted to the depression of a rival nation, will naturally\\nabound with regulations to interdict upon the productions of the soil\\nor industry of the other which come in competition with its own, and\\nwill present encouragement, perhaps even bounty, to the raw material of\\nthe other State which it can not produce itself, and which is essential\\nfor the use of its manufactures, competitors in the markets of the\\nworld with those of its commercial rival.\\n\\nSuch is the state of commercial legislation of Great Britain as it\\nbears upon our interests. It excludes with interdicting duties all\\nimportation (except in time of approaching famine) of the great staple\\nof production of our Middle and Western States; it proscribes with\\nequal rigor the bulkier lumber and live stock of the same portion and\\nalso of the Northern and Eastern part of our Union. It refuses even the\\nrice of the South unless aggravated with a charge of duty upon the\\nNorthern carrier who brings it to them. But the cotton, indispensable\\nfor their looms, they will receive almost duty free to weave it into a\\nfabric for our own wear, to the destruction of our own manufactures,\\nwhich they are enabled thus to under-sell.\\n\\nIs the self-protecting energy of this nation so helpless that there\\nexists in the political institutions of our country no power to\\ncounter-act the bias of this foreign legislation; that the growers of\\ngrain must submit to this exclusion from the foreign markets of their\\nproduce; that the shippers must dismantle their ships, the trade of the\\nNorth stagnate at the wharves, and the manufacturers starve at their\\nlooms, while the whole people shall pay tribute to foreign industry to\\nbe clad in a foreign garb; that the Congress of the Union are impotent\\nto restore the balance in favor of native industry destroyed by the\\nstatutes of another realm?\\n\\nMore just and generous sentiments will, I trust, prevail. If the tariff\\nadopted at the last session of Congress shall be found by experience to\\nbear oppressively upon the interests of any one section of the Union,\\nit ought to be, and I can not doubt will be, so modified as to\\nalleviate its burden. To the voice of just complaint from any portion\\nof their constituents the representatives of the States and of the\\npeople will never turn away their ears.\\n\\nBut so long as the duty of the foreign shall operate only as a bounty\\nupon the domestic article; while the planter and the merchant and the\\nshepherd and the husbandman shall be found thriving in their\\noccupations under the duties imposed for the protection of domestic\\nmanufactures, they will not repine at the prosperity shared with\\nthemselves by their fellow citizens of other professions, nor denounce\\nas violations of the Constitution the deliberate acts of Congress to\\nshield from the wrongs of foreigns the native industry of the Union.\\n\\nWhile the tariff of the last session of Congress was a subject of\\nlegislative deliberation it was foretold by some of its opposers that\\none of its necessary consequences would be to impair the revenue. It is\\nyet too soon to pronounce with confidence that this prediction was\\nerroneous. The obstruction of one avenue of trade not unfrequently\\nopens an issue to another. The consequence of the tariff will be to\\nincrease the exportation and to diminish the importation of some\\nspecific articles; but by the general law of trade the increase of\\nexportation of one article will be followed by an increased importation\\nof others, the duties upon which will supply the deficiencies which the\\ndiminished importation would otherwise occasion. The effect of taxation\\nupon revenue can seldom be foreseen with certainty. It must abide the\\ntest of experience.\\n\\nAs yet no symptoms of diminution are perceptible in the receipts of the\\nTreasury. As yet little addition of cost has even been experienced upon\\nthe articles burdened with heavier duties by the last tariff. The\\ndomestic manufacturer supplies the same or a kindred article at a\\ndiminished price, and the consumer pays the same tribute to the labor\\nof his own country-man which he must otherwise have paid to foreign\\nindustry and toil.\\n\\nThe tariff of the last session was in its details not acceptable to the\\ngreat interests of any portion of the Union, not even to the interest\\nwhich it was specially intended to subserve. Its object was to balance\\nthe burdens upon native industry imposed by the operation of foreign\\nlaws, but not to aggravate the burdens of one section of the Union by\\nthe relief afforded to another. To the great principle sanctioned by\\nthat act--one of those upon which the Constitution itself was formed--I\\nhope and trust the authorities of the Union will adhere. But if any of\\nthe duties imposed by the act only relieve the manufacturer by\\naggravating the burden of the planter, let a careful revisal of its\\nprovisions, enlightened by the practical experience of its effects, be\\ndirected to retain those which impart protection to native industry and\\nremove or supply the place of those which only alleviate one great\\nnational interest by the depression of another.\\n\\nThe United States of America and the people of every State of which\\nthey are composed are each of them sovereign powers. The legislative\\nauthority of the whole is exercised by Congress under authority granted\\nthem in the common Constitution. The legislative power of each State is\\nexercised by assemblies deriving their authority from the constitution\\nof the State. Each is sovereign within its own province. The\\ndistribution of power between them presupposes that these authorities\\nwill move in harmony with each other. The members of the State and\\nGeneral Governments are all under oath to support both, and allegiance\\nis due to the one and to the other. The case of a conflict between\\nthese two powers has not been supposed, nor has any provision been made\\nfor it in our institutions; as a virtuous nation of ancient times\\nexisted more than five centuries without a law for the punishment of\\nparricide.\\n\\nMore than once, however, in the progress of our history have the people\\nand the legislatures of one or more States, in moments of excitement,\\nbeen instigated to this conflict; and the means of effecting this\\nimpulse have been allegations that the acts of Congress to be resisted\\nwere unconstitutional. The people of no one State have ever delegated\\nto their legislature the power of pronouncing an act of Congress\\nunconstitutional, but they have delegated to them powers by the\\nexercise of which the execution of the laws of Congress within the\\nState may be resisted. If we suppose the case of such conflicting\\nlegislation sustained by the corresponding executive and judicial\\nauthorities, patriotism and philanthropy turn their eyes from the\\ncondition in which the parties would be placed, and from that of the\\npeople of both, which must be its victims.\\n\\nThe reports from the Secretary of War and the various subordinate\\noffices of the resort of that Department present an exposition of the\\npublic administration of affairs connected with them through the course\\nof the current year. The present state of the Army and the distribution\\nof the force of which it is composed will be seen from the report of\\nthe Major General. Several alterations in the disposal of the troops\\nhave been found expedient in the course of the year, and the discipline\\nof the Army, though not entirely free from exception, has been\\ngenerally good.\\n\\nThe attention of Congress is particularly invited to that part of the\\nreport of the Secretary of War which concerns the existing system of\\nour relations with the Indian tribes. At the establishment of the\\nFederal Government under the present Constitution of the United States\\nthe principle was adopted of considering them as foreign and\\nindependent powers and also as proprietors of lands. They were,\\nmoreover, considered as savages, whom it was our policy and our duty to\\nuse our influence in converting to Christianity and in bringing within\\nthe pale of civilization.\\n\\nAs independent powers, we negotiated with them by treaties; as\\nproprietors, we purchased of them all the lands which we could prevail\\nupon them to sell; as brethren of the human race, rude and ignorant, we\\nendeavored to bring them to the knowledge of religion and letters. The\\nultimate design was to incorporate in our own institutions that portion\\nof them which could be converted to the state of civilization. In the\\npractice of European States, before our Revolution, they had been\\nconsidered as children to be governed; as tenants at discretion, to be\\ndispossessed as occasion might require; as hunters to be indemnified by\\ntrifling concessions for removal from the grounds from which their game\\nwas extirpated. In changing the system it would seem as if a full\\ncontemplation of the consequences of the change had not been taken.\\n\\nWe have been far more successful in the acquisition of their lands than\\nin imparting to them the principles or inspiring them with the spirit\\nof civilization. But in appropriating to ourselves their hunting\\ngrounds we have brought upon ourselves the obligation of providing them\\nwith subsistence; and when we have had the rare good fortune of\\nteaching them the arts of civilization and the doctrines of\\nChristianity we have unexpectedly found them forming in the midst of\\nourselves communities claiming to be independent of ours and rivals of\\nsovereignty within the territories of the members of our Union. This\\nstate of things requires that a remedy should be provided--a remedy\\nwhich, while it shall do justice to those unfortunate children of\\nnature, may secure to the members of our confederation their rights of\\nsovereignty and of soil. As the outline of a project to that effect,\\nthe views presented in the report of the Secretary of War are\\nrecommended to the consideration of Congress.\\n\\nThe report from the Engineer Department presents a comprehensive view\\nof the progress which has been made in the great systems promotive of\\nthe public interest, commenced and organized under authority of\\nCongress, and the effects of which have already contributed to the\\nsecurity, as they will hereafter largely contribute to the honor and\\ndignity, of the nation.\\n\\nThe first of these great systems is that of fortifications, commenced\\nimmediately after the close of our last war, under the salutary\\nexperience which the events of that war had impressed upon our country-\\nmen of its necessity. Introduced under the auspices of my immediate\\npredecessor, it has been continued with the persevering and liberal\\nencouragement of the Legislature, and, combined with corresponding\\nexertions for the gradual increase and improvement of the Navy,\\nprepares for our extensive country a condition of defense adapted to\\nany critical emergency which the varying course of events may bring\\nforth. Our advances in these concerted systems have for the last ten\\nyears been steady and progressive, and in a few years more will be so\\ncompleted as to leave no cause for apprehension that our sea coast will\\never again offer a theater of hostile invasion.\\n\\nThe next of these cardinal measures of policy is the preliminary to\\ngreat and lasting works of public improvement in the surveys of roads,\\nexamination for the course of canals, and labors for the removal of the\\nobstructions of rivers and harbors, first commenced by the act of\\nCongress of April 30th, 1824.\\n\\nThe report exhibits in one table the funds appropriated at the last and\\npreceding sessions of Congress for all these fortifications, surveys,\\nand works of public improvement, the manner in which these funds have\\nbeen applied, the amount expended upon the several works under\\nconstruction, and the further sums which may be necessary to complete\\nthem; in a second, the works projected by the Board of Engineers which\\nhave not been commenced, and the estimate of their cost; in a third,\\nthe report of the annual Board of Visitors at the Military Academy at\\nWest Point.\\n\\nFor thirteen fortifications erecting on various points of our Atlantic\\ncoast, from Rhode Island to Louisiana, the aggregate expenditure of the\\nyear has fallen little short of $1,000,000. For the preparation of five\\nadditional reports of reconnoissances and surveys since the last\\nsession of Congress, for the civil construction upon 37 different\\npublic works commenced, eight others for which specific appropriations\\nhave been made by acts of Congress, and twenty other incipient surveys\\nunder the authority given by the act of April 30th, 1824, about\\n$1,000,000 more has been drawn from the Treasury.\\n\\nTo these $2,000,000 is to be added the appropriation of $250,000 to\\ncommence the erection of a break-water near the mouth of the Delaware\\nRiver, the subscriptions to the Delaware and Chesapeake, the Louisville\\nand Portland, the Dismal Swamp, and the Chesapeake and Ohio canals, the\\nlarge donations of lands to the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and\\nAlabama for objects of improvements within those States, and the sums\\nappropriated for light-houses, buoys, and piers on the coast; and a\\nfull view will be taken of the munificence of the nation in the\\napplication of its resources to the improvement of its own condition.\\n\\nOf these great national under-takings the Academy at West Point is\\namong the most important in itself and the most comprehensive in its\\nconsequences. In that institution a part of the revenue of the nation\\nis applied to defray the expense of educating a competent portion of\\nher youth chiefly to the knowledge and the duties of military life. It\\nis the living armory of the nation. While the other works of\\nimprovement enumerated in the reports now presented to the attention of\\nCongress are destined to ameliorate the face of nature, to multiply the\\nfacilities of communication between the different parts of the Union,\\nto assist the labors, increase the comforts, and enhance the enjoyments\\nof individuals, the instruction acquired at West Point enlarges the\\ndominion and expands the capacities of the mind. Its beneficial results\\nare already experienced in the composition of the Army, and their\\ninfluence is felt in the intellectual progress of society. The\\ninstitution is susceptible still of great improvement from benefactions\\nproposed by several successive Boards of Visitors, to whose earnest and\\nrepeated recommendations I cheerfully add my own.\\n\\nWith the usual annual reports from the Secretary of the Navy and the\\nBoard of Commissioners will be exhibited to the view of Congress the\\nexecution of the laws relating to that department of the public\\nservice. The repression of piracy in the West Indian and in the Grecian\\nseas has been effectually maintained, with scarcely any exception.\\nDuring the war between the Governments of Buenos Ayres and of Brazil\\nfrequent collisions between the belligerent acts of power and the\\nrights of neutral commerce occurred. Licentious blockades, irregularly\\nenlisted or impressed sea men, and the property of honest commerce\\nseized with violence, and even plundered under legal pretenses, are\\ndisorders never separable from the conflicts of war upon the ocean.\\n\\nWith a portion of them the correspondence of our commanders on the\\neastern aspect of the South American coast and among the islands of\\nGreece discover how far we have been involved. In these the honor of\\nour country and the rights of our citizens have been asserted and\\nvindicated. The appearance of new squadrons in the Mediterranean and\\nthe blockade of the Dardanelles indicate the danger of other obstacles\\nto the freedom of commerce and the necessity of keeping our naval force\\nin those seas. To the suggestions repeated in the report of the\\nSecretary of the Navy, and tending to the permanent improvement of this\\ninstitution, I invite the favorable consideration of Congress.\\n\\nA resolution of the House of Representatives requesting that one of our\\nsmall public vessels should be sent to the Pacific Ocean and South Sea\\nto examine the coasts, islands, harbors, shoals, and reefs in those\\nseas, and to ascertain their true situation and description, has been\\nput in a train of execution. The vessel is nearly ready to depart. The\\nsuccessful accomplishment of the expedition may be greatly facilitated\\nby suitable legislative provisions, and particularly by an\\nappropriation to defray its necessary expense. The addition of a 2nd,\\nand perhaps a 3rd, vessel, with a slight aggravation of the cost, would\\ncontribute much to the safety of the citizens embarked on this under-\\ntaking, the results of which may be of the deepest interest to our\\ncountry.\\n\\nWith the report of the Secretary of the Navy will be submitted, in\\nconformity to the act of Congress of March 3d, 1827, for the gradual\\nimprovement of the Navy of the United States, statements of the\\nexpenditures under that act and of the measures for carrying the same\\ninto effect. Every section of that statute contains a distinct\\nprovision looking to the great object of the whole--the gradual\\nimprovement of the Navy. Under its salutary sanction stores of ship\\ntimber have been procured and are in process of seasoning and\\npreservation for the future uses of the Navy. Arrangements have been\\nmade for the preservation of the live oak timber growing on the lands\\nof the United States, and for its reproduction, to supply at future and\\ndistant days the waste of that most valuable material for ship building\\nby the great consumption of it yearly for the commercial as well as for\\nthe military marine of our country.\\n\\nThe construction of the two dry docks at Charlestown and at Norfolk is\\nmaking satisfactory progress toward a durable establishment. The\\nexaminations and inquiries to ascertain the practicability and\\nexpediency of a marine railway at Pensacola, though not yet\\naccomplished, have been postponed but to be more effectually made. The\\nnavy yards of the United States have been examined, and plans for their\\nimprovement and the preservation of the public property therein at\\nPortsmouth, Charlestown, Philadelphia, Washington, and Gosport, and to\\nwhich two others are to be added, have been prepared and received my\\nsanction; and no other portion of my public duties has been performed\\nwith a more intimate conviction of its importance to the future welfare\\nand security of the Union.\\n\\nWith the report from the Post Master General is exhibited a comparative\\nview of the gradual increase of that establishment, from five to five\\nyears, since 1792 'til this time in the number of post offices, which\\nhas grown from less than 200 to nearly 8,000; in the revenue yielded by\\nthem, which from $67,000 has swollen to upward of $1,500,000, and in\\nthe number of miles of post roads, which from 5,642 have multiplied to\\n114,536. While in the same period of time the population of the Union\\nhas about thrice doubled, the rate of increase of these offices is\\nnearly 40, and of the revenue and of traveled miles from 20 to 25 for\\none. The increase of revenue within the last five years has been nearly\\nequal to the whole revenue of the Department in 1812.\\n\\nThe expenditures of the Department during the year which ended on July\\n1st, 1828 have exceeded the receipts by a sum of about $25,000. The\\nexcess has been occasioned by the increase of mail conveyances and\\nfacilities to the extent of near 800,000 miles. It has been supplied by\\ncollections from the post masters of the arrearages of preceding years.\\nWhile the correct principle seems to be that the income levied by the\\nDepartment should defray all its expenses, it has never been the policy\\nof this Government to raise from this establishment any revenue to be\\napplied to any other purposes. The suggestion of the Post Master\\nGeneral that the insurance of the safe transmission of moneys by the\\nmail might be assumed by the Department for a moderate and competent\\nremuneration will deserve the consideration of Congress.\\n\\nA report from the commissioner of the public buildings in this city\\nexhibits the expenditures upon them in the course of the current year.\\nIt will be seen that the humane and benevolent intentions of Congress\\nin providing, by the act of May 20th, 1826, for the erection of a\\npenitentiary in this District have been accomplished. The authority of\\nfurther legislation is now required for the removal to this tenement of\\nthe offenders against the laws sentenced to atone by personal\\nconfinement for their crimes, and to provide a code for their\\nemployment and government while thus confined.\\n\\nThe commissioners appointed, conformably to the act of March 2d, 1827,\\nto provide for the adjustment of claims of persons entitled to\\nindemnification under the first article of the treaty of Ghent, and for\\nthe distribution among such claimants of the sum paid by the Government\\nof Great Britain under the convention of November 13th, 1826, closed\\ntheir labors on August 30th, 1828 last by awarding to the claimants the\\nsum of $1,197,422.18, leaving a balance of $7,537.82, which was\\ndistributed ratably amongst all the claimants to whom awards had been\\nmade, according to the directions of the act.\\n\\nThe exhibits appended to the report from the Commissioner of the\\nGeneral Land Office present the actual condition of that common\\nproperty of the Union. The amount paid into the Treasury from the\\nproceeds of lands during the year 1827 and for the first half of 1828\\nfalls little short of $2,000,000. The propriety of further extending\\nthe time for the extinguishment of the debt due to the United States by\\nthe purchasers of the public lands, limited by the act of March 21st,\\n1828 to July 4th, 1829, will claim the consideration of Congress, to\\nwhose vigilance and careful attention the regulation, disposal, and\\npreservation of this great national inheritance has by the people of\\nthe United States been intrusted.\\n\\nAmong the important subjects to which the attention of the present\\nCongress has already been invited, and which may occupy their further\\nand deliberate discussion, will be the provision to be made for taking\\nthe 5th census of enumeration of the inhabitants of the United States.\\nThe Constitution of the United States requires that this enumeration\\nshould be made within every term of ten years, and the date from which\\nthe last enumeration commenced was the first Monday of August of the\\nyear 1820.\\n\\nThe laws under which the former enumerations were taken were enacted at\\nthe session of Congress immediately preceding the operation; but\\nconsiderable inconveniences were experienced from the delay of\\nlegislation to so late a period. That law, like those of the preceding\\nenumerations, directed that the census should be taken by the marshals\\nof the several districts and Territories of the Union under\\ninstructions from the Secretary of State. The preparation and\\ntransmission to the marshals of those instructions required more time\\nthan was then allowed between the passage of the law and the day when\\nthe enumeration was to commence. The term of six months limited for the\\nreturns of the marshals was also found even then too short, and must be\\nmore so now, when an additional population of at least 3,000,000 must\\nbe presented upon the returns.\\n\\nAs they are to be made at the short session of Congress, it would, as\\nwell as from other considerations, be more convenient to commence the\\nenumeration from an earlier period of the year than the first of\\nAugust. The most favorable season would be the spring.\\n\\nOn a review of the former enumerations it will be found that the plan\\nfor taking every census has contained many improvements upon that of\\nits predecessor. The last is still susceptible of much improvement. The\\n3rd Census was the first at which any account was taken of the\\nmanufactures of the country. It was repeated at the last enumeration,\\nbut the returns in both cases were necessarily very imperfect. They\\nmust always be so, resting, of course, only upon the communications\\nvoluntarily made by individuals interested in some of the manufacturing\\nestablishments. Yet they contained much valuable information, and may\\nby some supplementary provision of the law be rendered more effective.\\n\\nThe columns of age, commencing from infancy, have hitherto been\\nconfined to a few periods, all under the number of 45 years. Important\\nknowledge would be obtained by extending these columns, in intervals of\\nten years, to the utmost boundaries of human life. The labor of taking\\nthem would be a trifling addition to that already prescribed, and the\\nresult would exhibit comparative tables of longevity highly interesting\\nto the country. I deem it my duty further to observe that much of the\\nimperfections in the returns of the last and perhaps of preceding\\nenumerations proceeded from the inadequateness of the compensations\\nallowed to the marshals and their assistants in taking them.\\n\\nIn closing this communication it only remains for me to assure the\\nLegislature of my continued earnest wish for the adoption of measures\\nrecommended by me heretofore and yet to be acted on by them, and of the\\ncordial concurrence on my part in every constitutional provision which\\nmay receive their sanction during the session tending to the general\\nwelfare.\\n\\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS\"]"
