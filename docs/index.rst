Text Data Documentation Guide
======================================

:code:`text_data` is a tool designed to help you explore and analyze
text data. 

With a parallelized Rust code base, an efficient data
structure, and a suite of visual and statistical
tools backing it up, it gives you a strong starting point
to perform analyses using text data.

It is not a machine learning framework, nor is does it provide you
with all of the preprocessing tools you'll need to perform an analysis.
But it's designed to work well with ML frameworks or with libraries
like :code:`spacy` or :code:`nltk`.

If that sounds like the kind of thing that interests you, follow along
with the tutorial as I use :code:`text_data` to perform some analysis around the
`Kaggle State of the Union Corpus <https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/state-of-the-union-corpus-1989-2017>`_.
